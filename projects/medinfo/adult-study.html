<h2><em>Older adults, e-health literacy, and collaborative learning</em></h2>

<p class="citation"><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.21507/abstract" target="_blank">Xie, B. (2011). Older adults, e-health literacy, and collaborative learning: An experimental study. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 62(5), 933-946.</a></p>


<a name="question">
<h3>What Was Their Research Question?</h3></a>
<p>This study had two main areas of investigation: does Collaborative Learning (CL) work for improving e-health literacy for older adults, since CL has mostly been tested among college students?  And, what outcome measures detect the affects of CL for older learners?</p>

<p>Xie defines collaborative learning as &#34;any instructional method in which students work together in small groups toward a common goal&#34; (Prince, 2004, cited in Xie, 2011), and e-health literacy as, &#34;the ability to seek, find, understand, and appraise health information from electronic sources and apply the knowledge gained to addressing or solving a health problem&#34; (Norman & Skinner, 2006, cited in Xie, 2011).</p>

<a name="design">
<h3>What Was Their Study Design?</h3></a>
<p>The author included an extensive literature review that identified five gaps in the literature on collaborative learning.  These gaps include:</p>

<ol>
	<li><em>Generalizability</em>: most studies on CL have been done with college students so it is yet to be seen whether CL has benefits for older adults.</li>
	<li><em>Strategies</em>: most studies on CL have been vague about how CL is to be operationalized, including only vague instructions such as &#34;work together&#34; (Xie, 2011, p. 934).</li>
	<li><em>Outcome measures</em>: most studies on CL have included outcome measures specific to college students and would need to be modified for older adults.</li>
	<li><em>Group gender composition and group composition based on familiarity with partners</em>: no CL study has examined the effect of gender and familiarity with partners in the area of computer learning.</li>
	<li><em>Group composition based on prior computer experience</em>: previous studies have contradictory findings about whether people&#39;s learning is enhanced more by being in homogeneous or heterogeneous groups with respect to computer skill.</li>
</ol>

<p>The study was designed to address these gaps in the literature, so it seems that it does have the possibility of contributing to the scholarly literature in the areas of CL and e-health literacy.  Interestingly, the initial inspiration for the study was the author&#39;s &#34;hunch,&#34; based on anecdotal evidence, that &#34;the social, collaborative process of learning (e.g. peer learning, friendship development) is an important component of older adults&#39; learning of computers&#34; (Xie, 2011, p. 935).</p>

<p>Xie utilized multiple measures (fifteen total) to examine the effect of CL on e-health literacy, which makes sense given the author&#39;s interest in which instruments are sensitive to the effects CL.</p>

<strong>Instruments measured:</strong><br/><br/>

<em>Knowledge/skill gains</em>

<ul>
	<li>knowledge test of general computer/web information (e.g. &#34;what is the scroll bar&#34;)</li>
	<li>skill (procedural) test of general computer/web competence (e.g. &#34;open a web browser&#34;)</li>
	<li>e-health literacy efficacy survey (&#34;I know how to find helpful resources on the Internet&#34;)</li>
	<li>e-health literacy supplemental measures (Likert scale of 1 to 5 asking &#34;how useful is the Internet in helping make health decisions&#34; and &#34;how important is it for you to be able to access health resources on the internet&#34;)</li>
	<li>changes in health behavior/decision making (12 items, e.g. &#34;have you changed the way you take medicine because of the info on these sites?&#34;)</li>
	<li>learning effort (&#34;how many hours have you spent per week on preparing for this class?&#34;)</li>
</ul>

<em>Psychological adjustment for later life</em>

<ul>
	<li>personal self esteem (1 item, Likert scale of 1 to 5, asking &#34;I see myself as someone who has high self-esteem&#34;)</li>
	<li>self-efficacy (4 items, Likert scale of 1 to 5, asking about health, relationships, productivity)</li>
</ul>

<em>Attitude</em>

<ul>
	<li>attitudes toward computers, including computer anxiety, interest and efficacy</li>
	<li>attitudes toward the aging experience</li>
	<li>attitude toward the Collaborative Learning method</li>
	<li>attitudes toward the class</li>
</ul>

<em>Prior experience</em>

<ul>
	<li>prior experience with peers</li>
	<li>prior computer experience</li>
</ul>

<em>Basic demographics</em>

<ul>
	<li>age, gender, education, health status, race/ethnicity, income, primary language</li>
</ul>

<a name="collect">
<h3>How Did They Collect Data?</h3></a>
<p><strong>Instructional material:</strong> The instruction consisted of lesson plans and handouts following a free toolkit from the National Institutes of Health about senior health literacy (<a href="http://nihsenionhealth.gov/toolkit/toolkit.html">http://nihsenionhealth.gov/toolkit/toolkit.html</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Sampling:</strong> Recruitment happened at two public libraries in Maryland.  This choice was justified as convenient for the researchers, as well as suitable for particular recruitment of minorities, to give benefit to those populations. This ties nicely to the ethical principles of justice and beneficence, both of which are important parts of human subjects protections in the U.S.</p>

<p>They enrolled 172 participants enrolled, and 111 completed the 4-week program.  There was no monetary incentive for participation.</p>

<a name="findings">
<h3>What Did They Find?</h3></a>
<p>All measures except prior computer experience and basic demographics were given pre- and post-, that is, before and after the 4-week program.</p>

<p>Dependent <em>t tests</em> were run to examine the changes between pre and post-tests.  They found statistically significant improvements in all measures under knowledge/skill gains, as well as computer anxiety and attitude toward the Collaborative Learning method.</p>

<a name="strengths"><h3>Strengths</h3></a>
<ul>
	<li>Overall, this is a strong study, which is not surprising given its publication in JASIST, a highly reputable Information Science journal.</li>

	<li>Admitting to starting the study with a &#34;hunch&#34; is a rare and refreshing part of the research design of this study, since many studies start out with some kind of &#34;intuition&#34; but researchers rarely admit that. This might potentially be seen as a weakness by reviewers, but the subsequent grounding in the literature makes up for any aspect that might seem &#34;unscientific.&#34;</li>

	<li>Choosing to &#34;over-recruit&#34; minorities (recruiting more minorities than is proportional to the population at large) is well justified by the ethical principles of justice and beneficence.</li>

	<li>The detailed descriptions of how the study was performed means that this study could be replicated.</li>
</ul>

<a name="weaknesses"><h3>Weaknesses</h3></a>
<ul>
	<li>It is possible that one could argue that the over-recruiting of minority populations could make the study less generalizable. We would not argue this&mdash;but someone might. To their credit, they do state, &#34;The sample used in this study was not random. Caution should be taken when attempting to generalize the findings to other groups of older adults&#34; (p. 943).</li>

	<li>Unnamed &#34;graduate students&#34; are thanked at the end of the study for &#34;implementing the experiment&#34; (p. 944).  This seems like a massive undertaking that no single author could accomplish: Xie should acknowledge their debt to others with named co-authors for the most involved collaborators.</li>

	<li>There was no control group in this study, so it&#39;s not possible to make conclusions about CL versus other teaching/learning methods.</li>

	<li>The study had a retention rate of 65% of participants.  Those that stayed in the 4-week study reported being more healthy than those that dropped out.</li>

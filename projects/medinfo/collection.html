<h2><em>How Did They Collect Data?</em></h2>

<p>There was not a lot of variety in data collection methods across the four studies. Surprisingly, three of the four utilized surveys of some kind while the fourth study collected only brain scan data and nothing else. Besides a survey, the usability study used heuristic evaluation and usability testing to collect data. The intervention study mainly used pre- and post-test surveys, but also took advantage of procedural tests. The health resources training study, in addition to surveys, collected data through group interviews and observation of group and individual training sessions.</p>

<p>There is a problem with comparing all of these data collection methods: the medium used to convey the information. As the usability and intervention studies were presented as articles in journals, they are the quintessential public presentation of each study. On the other hand, the brain scan study is conveyed through a forty-two second video clip with no support text, and the health resources training study lives on a PowerPoint slide presentation with no recorded lecture. These media are meant more for quick conveyance of important information -- when a study must be truncated to fit, one of the first things to go is a discussion of the collection methods. Thus, we do not know much about the brain scan and health resources training studies, beyond what can be inferred from context.</p>

<p>The brain scan study uses the simplest collection methods. A single method, a brain scan, was used to collect information regarding brain activity in senior citizens who were reading and then surfing the web. As far as we can tell there were no other methods used, qualitative or quantitative. The presentation of this study is the most compact of all four, so it is appropriate that the most fleeting is also the most basic.</p>

<p>The other three studies all used some type of survey. The usability survey was strictly quantitative, using a 7-point Likert-type scale, while the intervention surveys were mainly quantitative with a few qualitative questions. The health resources training survey was strictly qualitative.</p>

<p>The usability study and the health resources training study each used three very different methods of data collection. This is in sharp contrast to the intervention study which, though it used a procedural test, focused on survey questions. This is in even sharper contrast to the brain scan study&#39;s single data collection method.</p>

<p>Patton (2005) states that &#34;we interview people to find out from them those things we cannot directly observe&#34; (p. 340). It is appropriate that the health resources study paired group interview with observations&mdash;this pairing effectively covers a larger range of data. Of the other studies, only the usability study used either; &#34;usability testing&#34; might be thought of as a hybrid interview/observation. Though the research question asked in the brain scan study would not be answered by implementing these methods, it is possible that the intervention study could have benefited from interviews and observations.</p>

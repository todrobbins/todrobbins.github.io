<h2><em>Conclusion</em></h2>

<p>Our research analysis compared and contrasted research results presented in a variety of ways. While all studies were research based, each presentation style varied depending on the intended audience.</p>
 
<p>Nahm et al (2004) and Xie (2011) both presented their research in the style of an academic paper. While research articles are a popular presentation style that have strengths such as peer review and meticulous detail of the study design, they are also hard to read and understand if the reader does not have an extensive understanding of the subject matter being studied and jargon of the field. These studies are presented in a way that is suitable for other researchers, but the average person looking for information about older adults seeking health information online would not find these papers very accessible.</p>
 
<p>Dee (n.d) presented results in a PowerPoint presentation. This style also included research jargon, but the information was presented in easily digestible bullet points. While the presentation was intended for a professional librarian conference, this manageable style of data presentation makes this research more accessible to anyone who is creating training programs for the elderly.</p>
 
<p>NBC Digital Health Network. (n.d.) was the most assessable presentation style for the general population. The results were presented in a short 1 minute video, but any information relevant to the research methods and design were intentionally left out for clarity. If one was looking for a short, but informative data point, this style would be ideal, but other researchers will find this style less than ideal because there is no ability to replicate the study as methods are not listed and no mention of the research study name or researchers is available.</p>

<p>An ideal presentation style would incorporate all elements listed above to be accessible to both researchers and the everyday person. Every study should include details about the study design and methods used, but multimedia such as a short video presentation or slide show of bullet points would help make the results easy to digest for both audiences.</p>

<p>While some of the studies analyzed in our project could fall into Creswell&#39;s description of a poor research study, we hesitate to describe them as such. Presentation style had a large effect on the amount of information available to analyze. According to Creswell (2005), the NBC Digital Health Network. (n.d.) study would be considered a poor study since the data-gathering methods are not clearly described and there is no information about the sample recruitment, data analysis or limitations of the study. However, we feel this reflects much more on the style of presentation than the research study itself. We do find fault that any information related to the official research paper was not included in the report.</p>

<p>We were able to use Creswell&#39;s evaluation of a research study to deconstruct both Nahm et al (2004) and Xie (2011). Both studies address key problems facing the elderly population and add to the scholarly knowledge concerning their use of online information to find health information. Both studies also seemed to be high in validity, that, is the study truly measured what it intended to measure; they repurposed standard measures from other reputable researchers. While the Xie (2011) study had high reliability, Nahm et al (2004) was not. The usability study utilized a small sample size for the usability testing and only four experts for the heuristic evaluation. It is quite possible that if this test was to be repeated, different results may be obtained.</p>

<p>Overall, we would suggest that all research processes and products are likely to have room for improvement.  As Patton says, a researcher should always &#34;be open to the possibility that what has been learned most from a particular inquiry is how to do it better next time&#34; (p. 588).  In that spirit, we look forward to your feedback. Thank you for visiting!</p>

<h2><em>What Was Their Study Design?</em></h2>

<p>These four studies cover a variety of design possibilities that range from fully qualitative to completely quantitative, with two featuring an unbalanced mix of both. The brain activity study is a single-method design while the Intervention study employs longitudinal survey design within a mixed-methods triangulation context. Both the health resources training study and the usability study are participatory action research. In all, these studies utilize a good mix of research designs covering both qualitative and quantitative methods.</p>

<p>Creswell (2005) defines participatory action research as that which &#34;Improve[s] the quality of people&#39;s organizations, communities, and family lives&#34; (p. 555). The usability study we looked at, as well as the health resources training study, focused on the effectiveness of current evaluation techniques. In the case of the usability study, this was not the intention of the original research question. The researchers were using methods based on judging usability in younger populations and as a result of using them to assess an elderly population the researchers were able to identify ways in which the evaluation tools might be modified to better address the needs of this age group. The health resources training study was conducted as a result of a subcontract aimed specifically at training senior citizens how to use online health databases; participatory action research was an effective design choice. The qualitative methods used fit well with the main objective: helping seniors become more comfortable with the use of these databases.</p>

<p>In contrast to the health resources training study, which was fully qualitative in nature, the brain activity study focused on a single quantitative measure. The design, within-group repeated-measures, was appropriate for the research question. Researchers were only interested in senior citizens with no history of dementia, which satisfies the within-group design requirements. As described by Creswell (2005), a repeated measures design is one in which &#34;the researcher compares a group&#39;s performance under one experimental treatment with its performance under another experimental treatment&#34; (p. 303). The comparison of brain activity during reading with brain activity during web surfing perfectly addresses this design.</p>

<p>Though the other three studies are singularly focused, the intervention study has a more complicated design. This study is built around a four-week program about a collaborative learning method with multiple pre- and post-test surveys given to participants&mdash;this is a classic longitudinal survey design. Within this framework, however, the researchers employed a mixed-methods triangulation design; there were multiple surveys with different types of questions, both qualitative and quantitative, meant to gauge different aspects of the effectiveness of the collaborative learning program. In that sense, this study joins the usability and health resource training studies as action research, since part of the point was to evaluate the effectiveness of this program.</p>

<h2><em>What Did They Find?</em></h2>

<p>While the studies analyzed involved different research methods and designs, the findings were complimentary and have significant implications for future research. The NBC Digital Health Network (n.d.) study showed that website use stimulates the brain in similar ways to reading. Two other research studies, Xie (2011) and Dee (n.d.), showed that the elderly successfully learned technology skills in a hands-on, face-to-face environment, while Nahm et al (2004) discussed features a website must have to be accessible to this population. All these findings lead us to the conclusion that it is important to offer digital resources that can be accessed by older adults, and designers must keep in mind the mental and physical limitations of this population.</p> 

<p>One research study may seem very different from another upon first glance; in actuality these studies are all complimentary and explore different ways to make discoveries and present those revelations. Like the blind men who only felt one part of an elephant and could not agree on what it looked like, individual researchers, participants, and audience members must remember that &#34;there may be some truth to what someone says. Sometimes we can see that truth and sometimes not because they may have different perspective which we may not agree to&#34; (Jain World).</p>

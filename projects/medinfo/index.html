<h2><em>A comparative analysis of various research products</em></h2>
<p>Welcome!  This website is a comparison of the research methods and products of four different research endeavors about medical information seeking and use among the elderly in the United States.  Below, you will find investigation of the studies' <a href="question.html">research questions</a>, <a href="design.html">study design</a>, <a href="collection.html">data collection</a>, and <a href="findings.html">findings</a>.  You will also find our analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each article.</p>

<p>While all the studies share an interest in this special population (older adults in the U.S.), they differ widely in their approach to the topics.  In the comparison sections of this website, we compare and contrast the ways in which the studies go about conducting research.  We <a href="conclusion.html">conclude</a> with some thoughts on the relative strengths and weakness of different presentation formats displayed in these research products, as well as some <a href="resources.html">resources</a> that anyone interested in this topic might find useful.  Enjoy!</p>

<td><a href="usability.html">Usability of health Web sites for older adults: a preliminary study</a><a href="http://www.jmir.org/2011/2/e35/" target="_blank"><img class="www" src="pdf.png"></a></td>
<td><a href="usability.html#question">What usability problems do the elderly population in the United States face when looking for health information online?</a></td>
<td><a href="usability.html#design">This study employed both qualitative designs with some quantitative measures and participatory action research.</a></td>
<td><a href="usability.html#collect">Data were collected through  a heuristic evaluation, usability testing, and a survey questionnaire.</a></td>
<td><a href="usability.html#findings">Discovered usability method must be reassessed to test older adults. Many websites that claim to be designed for the elderly, have some serious design flaws, such as no labels on video players or difficult to read type.</a></td>
<td><a href="usability.html#strengths">This study was the first to test website usability for older adults. Academic papers are a good format for presenting research findings because an exhaustive explanation of the research- a public record of the experimental event.</a></td>
<td><a href="usability.html#strengths">Small sample size does not make findings generalizable to the elderly population at large. This article was not peer reviewed. Academic papers are not easily understood by those without specialized and arcane training.</a></td>

<td><a href="adult-study.html#question">Does Collaborative Learning help improve e-health literacy for older adults?</a></td>
<td><a href="adult-study.html#design">This multi-measure experimental study employed a pre- and post-test design.</a></td>
<td><a href="adult-study.html#collect">Data were collected through pre- and post-test surveys and procedural tests.</a></td>
<td><a href="adult-study.html#findings">Discovered that collaborative learning can help older adults improve e-health literacy.</a></td>
<td><a href="adult-study.html#strengths">A few strengths of this study are study origins, recruitment, and intervention description. A strength of this research presentation style is the results are peer reviewed before publication.</a></td>
<td><a href="adult-study.html#weaknesses">Weaknesses of this study include no control group, subject retention rate was low, and no credit was given to co-researchers. A weakness of this presentation style is jargon makes it inaccessible to the general population.</a></td>

<td><a href="internet.html#question">How does Internet browsing affect brain activity in the elderly?</a></td>
<td><a href="internet.html#design">This study employed quantitative within-group repeated measures.</a></td>
<td><a href="internet.html#collect">Researchers collected brain scans of participants while viewing the Internet and compared those to scans of participants who were reading print materials.</a></td>
<td><a href="internet.html#findings">The researchers discovered that the same areas of the brain are active while reading and web surfing, but more web experience resulted in higher levels of activity.</a></td>
<td><a href="internet.html#strengths">Researchers filtered out history of dementia and focused the sample age range. The video format is ideal for an overview on the results and it reaches a wider audience than academic papers.</a></td>
<td><a href="internet.html#weaknesses">This study might have issues with external validity. Two weakness of using a video clip to present research data is it is too short to adequately address the study and an absence of text equates to lower searchability on the web.</a></td>

<td><a href="seniors.html#design">This study employed multi-layered qualitative participatory action research.</a></td>
<td><a href="seniors.html#collect">Data were collected through a survey, group interview, and an observation of group and individual training sessions.</a></td>
<td><a href="seniors.html#findings">Researchers identified many helpful tips for effectively training senior citizens, whose information-seeking practices included working methodically and being self-sufficient but appreciative.</a></td>
<td><a href="seniors.html#strengths">Action research method was appropriate for the research question; the variety of methods led to a variety of data. Slides were easily digestible with searchable text.</a></td>
<td><a href="seniors.html#weaknesses">The study lacks any quantitative methods and might experience issues with internal validity. A slide deck is a visual aid, not a paper, so there is missing information. The location on the web makes it hard to find context.</a></td>

<a name="question">
<h3>What Was Their Research Question?</h3></a>
<p>A reporter for the NBC Digital Health Network narrates a short video clip regarding a study on how Internet use affects brain activity in the elderly.</p>

<a name="design">
<h3>What Was Their Study Design?</h3></a>
<p>This study was a quantitative, within-group, repeated measures experiment. Researchers split the senior citizens into two groups&mdash;those with experience surfing the web and those without web experience&mdash;and conducted brain scans while each group read and browsed the Internet. These scans were then compared across activities and groups.</p>

<a name="collect">
<h3>How Did They Collect Data?</h3></a> 
<p>Researchers put together a group of 24 senior citizens who did not have a history of dementia and split them into two groups, half with experience browsing the Internet and half without any experience. Researchers then had the groups perform two tasks, reading and web surfing, and took brain scans of the seniors while they performed the tasks.</p>

<a name="findings">
<h3>What Did They Find?</h3></a>
<p>Comparison of the scans across activities and groups yielded results. Areas of the brain that were active when reading were similarly active when surfing the web, along with other areas active when online. Across groups, researchers found that those seniors with more experience surfing the web had higher levels of activity in those areas compared with the group that had no experience.</p>

<a name="strengths"><h3>Strengths</h3></a>
<ul>
	<li>Quantitative method was appropriate for the research question.</li>

	<li>Limited outside influence by filtering for history of dementia.</li>

	<li>42 second video means viewers are given the most important points quickly.</li>
</ul>

<a name="weaknesses"><h3>Weaknesses</h3></a>
<ul>
	<li>Without full health history, it&#39;s hard to guarantee external validity.</li>

	<li>Video makes no mention of the title of the study, so it is harder to find.</li>

	<li>Video is short, and being so results in almost no information about the structure of the study&mdash;no knowledge of the sampling methods or of the methods of comparison for the scans.</li>

	<li>There is no accompanying article, which limits its &#34;findability&#34; on the web.</li>
</ul>

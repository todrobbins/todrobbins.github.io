<h2><em>What Was Their Research Question?</em></h2>

<p>Our four research products asked relatively different questions about medical information seeking and use among the elderly.  We looked into how these research questions fell into Patton&#39;s (2002) spectrum of research, ranging from theory to action.  According to Patton&#39;s schema, basic research is at one end of the spectrum and, &#34;contribute[s] to fundamental knowledge and theory&#34; (p. 213), while action research, or research "to solve a specific problem" (p. 213), occupies the other end of the spectrum.  Researchers who position themselves at different points in this spectrum then find themselves asking different types of research questions.</p>

<p>In our sample, we suggest that only one study qualifies as basic research.  The study described in NBC Digital Health Network (n.d.) asked how Internet use affects brain activity in the elderly.  More generally, that research question could be phrased as, &#34;what does performing certain activities do to activity measurable by brain scans?&#34;  This has the potential to contribute to our general knowledge about how the brain works, but the NBC commentary on the study gave no evidence to support the narrator's conclusion that &#34;the internet could be good for older people's brains.&#34;  Therefore, this research product could qualify as basic research, but would need to include more details if researchers want to describe a specific application of the findings.</p>

<p>Nahm et al (2004), on the other hand, seems clearly to be applied research.  According to Patton (2002), &#34;[t]he purpose of applied research is to contribute knowledge that will help people understand the nature of a problem in order to intervene, thereby allowing human beings to more effectively control their environment&#34; (p. 217).  Nahm et al used their study to ask what usability problems the elderly population in the United States might face when looking for health information online.  The study following from this research question has the potential to, &#34;illuminate a societal concern&#34; (Patton, 2002, p. 213), namely that older adults may have trouble accessing important health-related information on the internet.</p>

<p>Xie (2011) and Dee (n.d.) are both applied research projects that have perhaps the most in common of any of the studies.   Both Xie and Dee studied the effect of a particularly health information literacy program on seniors&#39; learning.  However, their research questions differ in interesting ways.  Xie was particularly interested in the instructional method employed during the intervention (collaborative learning), and wanted to find out whether this method was effective.  Dee, on the other hand, was more focused on the content of the intervention (health databases) rather than the instructional delivery mode.  Because of these different research foci, their research projects, data collection methods, and findings ended up being very different from one another.  So, no matter what the type of research is, or where it falls on the theory-to-action scale, the research question shapes everything that comes after.</p>

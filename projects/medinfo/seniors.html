<h2><em>Lessons Learned: Outreach to Senior Citizens</em></h2>

<a name="question">
<h3>What Was Their Research Question?</h3></a>
<p>Under a subcontract grant from the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, researchers conducted sessions to train librarians to use health databases in a way that would meet seniors&#39; needs, train seniors themselves in the use of health databases, and &#34;provide practical information for librarians training seniors,&#34; all while studying the information seeking behaviors of senior citizens.</p>

<a name="design">
<h3>What Was Their Study Design?</h3></a>
<p>This qualitative action research was multi-layered. Researchers used three different methods to gather data related to their objectives. First, they created a survey with questions related to the information needs of senior citizens. Researchers also held group interviews with senior citizens. Finally, they observed both group and individual training sessions held for senior citizens regarding health database use.</p>

<a name="collect">
<h3>How Did They Collect Data?</h3></a> 
<p>Each method used in this study was qualitative; for two of the three methods the reader will not learn more than that. The survey and the group interviews are not discussed in greater detail and the slides contain no mention of the sample population beyond the phrase &#34;Senior Citizen.&#34; The training sessions are the only method discussed in any detail. The group training explained the benefits of quality resources for medical information while making clear the dangers of unquestioned trust in the truth of correctness of information found on the Internet. Seniors were encouraged to discuss their own access to health care and identify a personal topic of interest for each individual. Along with the projected slides, seniors were provided with a printout including all the screens used in the session. Student volunteers ran the one-on-one training sessions, spending 10 minutes with each individual and working with them to conduct a complete search and print a reference.</p>

<a name="findings">
<h3>What Did They Find?</h3></a>
<p>During the group training, the researchers noted that the senior citizens had many questions and found some things hard to understand, clearly indicating their need for hands-on computer training in an individualized environment.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is a slide addressing &#34;Information Seeking Behavior&#34;, which lists observations of, and feedback from, senior citizens, and could have been compiled from all three methods.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Worked methodically but effectively</li>
	<li>Asked good questions but cautiously</li>
	<li>Had limited attention spans, fatigued</li>
	<li>Wanted to search for themselves</li>
	<li>Appreciated assistance with features</li>
	<li>Wanted to search topics of personal interest</li>
</ul>

<p>Researchers also made some suggestions for those who wanted to plan their own training sessions. For groups, instructors should assess seniors&#39; levels of expertise, make note of the different levels, and structure their teaching at a level that will reach the majority of participants. Additionally, researchers suggested having students nearby to help with technological issues. For individual training sessions, suggestions included walking through generalized steps sequentially, leaving the seniors in charge and moving at their pace, and searching a topic of personal interest to each senior. Researchers noted that it is important to assess each senior citizen&#39;s ability and desire for more advanced, detail-oriented training.</p>

<p>Also included were some important suggestions for overall success&mdash;providing snacks was a great way to make participants feel at ease (cookies in particular were mentioned) and they loved small keepsakes such as &#34;drug rep&#34; pens and pencils.</p>

<a name="strengths"><h3>Strengths</h3></a>

<ul>
	<li>Using qualitative methods is an appropriate way to gauge the effectiveness of training, at least in terms of an opt-in, freely available library session.</li>

	<li>The variety of methods allows for the triangulation of important results.</li>

	<li>Action research is a great way to address these research questions.</li>

	<li>The slideshow format, as a visual aid, forces the creator to break down the topic of discussion into easily digestible pieces. This makes a study more consumable to the general public. Instead of reading and processing eight or more pages of text aimed at other researchers, a library instructor who is looking for tips to help her implement her own training sessions for the elderly can easily skim through these slides and pick out suggestions.</li>

	<li>Slides stick around, while the spoken words of a presentation fade away once they&#39;re uttered. Since this talk wasn&#39;t recorded, these slides are an easily searchable preservation of the main points of the study.</li>
</ul>

<a name="weaknesses"><h3>Weaknesses</h3></a>

<ul>
	<li>More data gathered quantitatively, such as some kind of rubric score for each senior citizen in both the group and the individual training, could have resulted in clearer findings.</li>

	<li>Who is usually in control of each individual senior&#39;s health research? If their children do most of the searching, then these effectiveness instructions would have more of an affect if taught to the primary health researcher.</li>

	<li>As it was meant to be a visual aid, none of the specifics of the study are here. We cannot find any recording of the presentation and there are no included speaker notes so there is no easy way to find out the details of the study.</li>

	<li>We found the study through a Google search, but the format does not favor linking back to the site it belongs to. We had to mess around with the URL structure of the saved file to find out where it came from (possibly the only way to find more specific information about the study, since more details about the presenter exist on the site).</li>

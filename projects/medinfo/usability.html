<h2><em>Usability of health Web sites for older adults</em></h2>

<a name="question">
<h3>What Was Their Research Question?</h3></a>
<p>The usability study conducted by Nahm and fellow researchers was interested to discover usability problems the elderly population in the United States might face when looking for health information online.</p>

<a name="design">
<h3>What Was Their Study Design?</h3></a>
<p>This research had a multi-layer design. Three different methods were used to determine potential usability problems while using websites designed to communicate health information to older adults. First, a heuristic evaluation was conducted using the NIH (National Institutes of Health) guidelines. Next, ten usability tests were conducted applying observation, think-aloud method, audio tapping, and an interview. Both of these first two aspects used a qualitative design with some quantitative measures. Lastly, participants were given a perceived usability questionnaire to complete. This aspect of the research study employed a quantitative design.</p>

<a name="collect">
<h3>How Did They Collect Data?</h3></a>
<p>For the first part of this study, four experts evaluated three websites each using the NIH guidelines. Each expert rated a website with either pass (1) or fail (2) on twenty-five principles split into four categories, which were: readability, presentation of information, incorporation of other media, and ease of navigation. All scores were then averaged to obtain one score in each of the four categories. Experts were also able to leave descriptive comments after their quantifiable evaluation.</p>

<p>For the second part, researchers asked 10 participants to complete specific tasks commonly performed when searching for health information; these tests took place at either the participant&#39;s home or a computer lab at a retirement community. The participants were assessed on learnability, efficiency, error rates, and user satisfaction by documenting the frequency they asked for help, number of failed paths they took, and the amount of time they needed to complete each task. The researchers also took notes during and after the interview on participant&#39;s comments as they thought aloud and any other relevant observations. A content analysis was then performed on these notes by coding and organizing them into the four categories of readability, presentation of information, incorporation of other media, and ease of navigation.</p>

<p>For the third part, participants were interviewed using the Perceived Health Web Site Usability Questionnaire after the usability test. The PHWSUQ is a questionnaire containing fifteen items that are rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 being Very Unsatisfied and 7 being Very Satisfied) in which participants were asked to rate each website on four dimensions: satisfaction, ease of use, usefulness, and logic of organization. These rating were then analyzed using descriptive statistics. The questionnaire also allowed participants to write comments in an open-ended text box.</p>

<a name="findings">
<h3>What Did They Find?</h3></a>
<p>Both the heuristic evaluation and usability test agreed on the main usability issues of the three websites tested. First, a dark typeface on a white background with a font size of 12 or 14 points and suitable space between the lines is imperative for ease of reading. Second, search features must contain few steps and clear, specific instructions. Cognitive changes, such as a decline in working memory, impair an older adult&#39;s ability to understand complex site navigation. Third, multimedia like video players must be clearly labeled with buttons showing how operate them.</p>

<a name="strengths"><h3>Strengths</h3></a>
<ul>
	<li>Previous to this study, there were only a few published about Web usability testing in older adults, so the researchers used methodologies that were developed with a younger user in mind. They found that older adults have unique needs and current usability methodologies, such as time required to complete each task, should be adapted to meet these needs.</li>

	<li>Academic papers are a good format for presenting research findings because an exhaustive explanation of the research&mdash;a public record of the experimental event.</li>

	<li>Due to the meticulous recording of method and study design, this research study would be easy to replicate in another setting.</li>
</ul>
<a name="weaknesses"><h3>Weaknesses</h3></a>
<ul>
	<li>This study has a small, unrepresentative  sample size so it is not generalizable to the elderly population as a whole.</li>

	<li>While this study was presented in an academic journal, it was not peer-reviewed.</li>

	<li>Academic papers are not easily understood by those without specialized and arcane training. They often use highly technical terms and a dry writing style so it is difficult to read if you are not familiar with the subject matter being studied.</li>

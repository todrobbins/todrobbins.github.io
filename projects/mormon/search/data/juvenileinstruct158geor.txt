MOTHER, AS A TEACHER. 




IT rE have here a sweet picture. It does one good to look at 
' ' it, for it fills the mind with pleasant and holy thoushts; 
it shows us woman in 
her highest, holiest 
character — that of a 
mother and a teacher 
to her children. 
Blessed are the chil- 
dren who have such a 
mother! No child is 
really. 'well educated, 
who lacks this sweet, 
early teaching. No 
schools, however high, 
can give the teachings 
of a mother to her 
young children. And 
many great and mighty 
men have borne to 
the world their testi- 
mony, that they were 
indebted to their 
mothers for all they 
had attained to, and 
that it was their moth- 
ers who had been their 
tutelar angels through 
life. 

Oh! mothers, think 
of this! Give a few 
moments of your time 
each day, to the in- 
struction of your chil- 
dren; even while you 
are at work you can 
teach them. If you 
have not time for a 
book lesson, talk to 
them at your work. 
f)ral teaching is a very 
powerful niodc, and 
was the only way in 
which the Jew.', in 




early times, taught their young people. But to return to the 
picture. The portrait of that mothtr represents a pure, calm, 

devoted woman; she is 
a woman of decided 
character. The scene 
we now view her in, 
is a phase of her 
every- day life. She has 
completed her morn- 
ing duties; has ar- 
ranged her toilet for 
the rest of the day; 
and she calls her chil- 
dren to come and she 
will read to them, and 
then they must read to 
her. They are in- 
stantly obedient, for 
you may see they have 
ilso dressed them- 
• elves neatly, and 
lone their hair nicely, 
'ocause "Mother is so 
larlioular!" and they 
nust always be neat in 
heir persons. So, 
<nowing .she would call 
them at a certain hour, 
they got ready to at- 
tend her summons, as 
they know their moth- 
er is a woman of order. 
You may read that in 
hor features, form and 
appearance. The eld- 
est girl is drinking in 
every word of what 
her mother is reading, 
and the little one is 
thinking, what a prct- 



I.V 



sson ! And how 



she wishes she could 
read like her mother ! 







■TTJ'VIIilLTIL 



i:N"STnE?.TJGTOI?.. 




But she will try and learn fast, and then, when mother is 
tired, she can read to her. After mother has finished the 
lesson, she asks the eldest one wLat she thinks about it, and if 
she likes it. And she has been thinking so deeply about it, 
that she starts at the question, and can only pxclaiin, "Oh! 
it's beautiful 1'' Then the ujoihtr talks to them about what 
she has been readinjr, and expluins to them anything she 
thinks they are too youns to understand. But I tell you they 
do coruprehond, though they could not I ell how. There is an 
intuition in most children, that is very remarkable; and that 
readirir is like sowing a little seed in the ground, where it lays 
in silence; but, after a while, behold, a lovely little green 
shoot springs up, and grows till it becomes a beautiful plant. 
It may be a flower, or it may be a tres, that will become so 
extensive that it will form a shade from the fierce sunshine, 
or a shelter from the storms in days to couie. 

Motliers and children, study this beautiful picture till you 
have warmed it into lile in your own bosoms, and then go and 
do likewise.

( Con tin HcJ. ) 

IN the year 7".. B. ('.. Alma delivered to his son Ilelamau 
a remarkable historiial prophecy. Said he: "Behold, I 
perceive that this very jieople, the Neidiites, according to the 
spirit of revelation which is in me, in four hundred years from 
the time that Jesus Christ shall manifest him.'ielf unto them, 
sliall dwindle lu unbelief; yea, and then .«hall they see wars 
and pestilence-:, yea. famines and bloodshed, even until the 
peojile of Xci'hi shall become extinct." 

Af\er he delivered this projdiecy to Ilelanum, Alma blessed 
him and his other sons. He also l)les.scd the land for the 
righteous' sake, and cursed it to the wicked. He soon after 
left the land of /arahcuda, as if to go to the land of Mulek, 
and was never heard of again. It was generally supposed by 
the church "that he was taken up by the Spirit, or buried by 
tbcliaml of the I>ord. even as .Moses." 

Ill tin; commenrcnicnt of this year Hdaman and his brethren 
traveled through the land, preaching and rci'stablLshing the 
duirch. 'Ilmso who would not believe their teachings became 
angry, and detcnnincd tn .>ilay them. Their leader was a large 
and strung man, named Amalickiah. He was desirous of 
lieinL' kiiiL', and among his followers were the greater portion 
of the lower judges of the land. I'hcy were seeking for 
power, and hail been flattered that, if tliey would siiiiport 
iiiin. he would place them in authority over the i)eople. 
'I'hosc ilisseiisions place<l the aflairs of the Nephites in a very 
critical condition. As a penplc, they appear to liave grcwii 
graduallv more tickle and ch.-iMireable in character. AVhen 
under the scourge nf aftlicliiui, they weie penitent and willing 
to do right; but in their prosperity tliey .soon forgot their 
covenants, and became wicked and contentious. These great 
disscn.-ions made Moroni angry with Amalickiali, aii<l he rent 
his inat and wiole on a i)ieie of it, "In iiieliMiij of our<;iid, 
niir ri'livii'ii. and irccdnlii, and our peafc. our wives, and our 
children. " He rai.-ed it 'mi a pole, and called it "the title of 
liberty," anil lie called upmi all who would lualntain it to enter 
into a i-ovonant to i.efcnd their li^hls and religion. The^e 
)iriicceiliiigs" raised an ei'llnisia>iii among the | eopie in the 
cause of liberty, and they loxenanicd that they would not 
forsake their (iod. 



3Ioroni gathered all the iieople together who were desirous 
of maintaining their liberty, from those parts of the land 
where there were dissenfeions, in order to oppose Amalickiali 
and his followers. When Amalickiah saw that the followers 
of Moroni were more numerous than his own, and that his 
were doubtful of the justice of their cause, he and his adher- 
ents went into the land of Xejihi. Moroni, deeming it unwise 
to permit Amalickiah to join the Lanianites, marched his army 
into the wilderness and headed him. He, however, succeeded 
in escai)!ng with a few men, but tbe remainder were taken 
back to Zarahemla. The most of them covenanted to sustain 
the caiT?e of freedom, and those who would not were jiut to 
death. ^loroni, at this time, bad great power bestowed upon 
him by the chief judges and the voice of the people, in all 
matters pertaining to the defense of the country. He caused 
the "title of liberty" to be raised on every tower in the land 
belonging to the Nephites, and peace was maintained until 
nearly the close of the following year. 

The historian. Alma, has given, in this connection, all that 
is said in the Book of Mormon on the practice of medicine: 
"And there were some who died with fevers, which at some 
seasons of the year were very frequent in the land; but not so 
much so with fevers, because of the excellent qualities of the 
many ])lants and roots which God had prepared to remove the 
cause of diseases, to whi.li men were subject by the nature of 
the climate." 

Auurlickiah, and those who escaped with him, stirred up 
the Lanianites to anger against the Nejihites to such an extent 
that the king of the former ordered his people to preimrc for 
war with their supposed hereditary enemies. But the terrible 
destruction of the Lanianites in their last battles had left a 
salutary impression ujion their minds of the jiower of the 
Nephites. This placed the masses of the people in a miserable 
dilemma. They were afraid of the Nephites on one hand, and 
of their king on the other. However, the majoriti' would not 
obey the king, and he gave Amalickiah command of that 
part of his army which was obedient, and ordered him to 
compel the others to take uji arms. This suited Amalickiah, 
for he wa.s already planning in his heart how to dethrone the 
king. Having obtained the command of those who were in 
favor of the kimr, he determined to gain the favor of those 
wlio were not. When the latter saw the army of the king 
apjiroaching they sup|)Osed it was coming to destroy them, 
and they fled to Onidah, the place of arms. Being determined 
that they would take no jnirt in a war with the Nephites, they 
had appointed another man to be tlieir leader, and in prepar- 
ation for liattle had taken jiosition on a mountain called 
Antipas. It being the intention of Amalickiah to gain Ihcir 
favor instead of fighting them, his army cam|icd in the valley 
near by. When night came, he sent three times to Lehonti, 
ihcir leader, to come down lo the foot of the UHmutaiii, as he 
wished to speak to him. Lehonti, probably suspecting 
treachery, refused to go. .Vuialickiah then went u|) nearly to 
his camp and sent a fourth nie,-;.sage to him, desiring a con- 
ference. All interview took place, in which Amalickiah pro- 
posed that the army of Lehonti should surround his caniji 
before morning, and. in consideration that he should be second 
in command, he would deliver his own army into his hands. 

'J'iie following morning the soldiers of Amalii-kiali found 
themselves surrounded by the army of Lehonti. Instead of 
fighting tliey requested the privilege of joining them. As 
this favored the jilaus of Ama'ickiali, be consented. Tt was 
customary among the Lamaiiites, when their leader wa< killed, 
to appoint the econil one in eoinmaiid to succeed bin 







a"Tj^:H]iNriiijE iisrsTie.TJOToi^. 




Amaliekiali brought about the death of Lahonti by a process 
of slow ])oisoning, and, in accordance with their custom, suc- 
ceeded him. Being now iu command of the Laraanite armies, 
he marched for Nephi, the capital city. The king, supposing 
that, in obedience to his orders, he had collected a large army 
foi;his contemplated attack upon the Nephices, went out with 
his guards to meet him. Instead of going himself, Amaliokiah 
sent his servants to receive the king. They bowed themselves 
before him, as was the custom, and he reached forth his hand 
to raise them, in token of peace. As the first raised from the 
ground, he stabbed the king in the heart. The servants of 
the king fled, and the servants of Amalickiah raised the cry 
that they had assassinated the king. Finding that his servants 
performed their part so well, in order to screen the real actors 
in the tragedy, Amalickiah ])retended to be angry on account 
of the king's death, and directed all those who loved him to 
pursue his servants and slay them. Tie king's servants 
e.scaped by fleeing to Zarahemla, and joining the people of 
Auimon. 

Thus, by his great crimes and duplicity, Amalickiah gained 
the hearts of the people. He also, by his cunning, succeeded 
in deceiving the ciucen as to the part he had acted in making 
her a widow. He even had the audacity to seek her favor 
and to marry the woman whose husband he had been the 
means of assassinating. 

Amalickiah was now the ruler of a great people, for he was 
acknowledged king by all the Lamanites. But he was not 
satisfied. Hatred and a desire for revenge inspired him with 
another project — the conquest of the Xephites, and, as a 
result, what seemed to him universal dominion.

INI O D E R N DISCOVERIES. 



BY BETH. 




(Continncd.) 

THE progress of the children of Israel is given by Dr. 
Brugseh as follows: 
From .Mount Casius the Israelites turned southward "into 
the wilderness of Shur." He gives the meaning of the word 
"Shur" as signifying wall, because this place was a barrier of 
mountains between ]Cgypt and Arabia. There was a city, 
however, called Shur, from which, probably, the wilderness 
was named. The ancient Xephites frequently named a dis- 
trict or country after the name of a city. The Israelites then 
still went on southward to the "bitter lakes," or s|)rings, near 
the present route of tlie Suez canal. These ai-e said to be the 
waters of "JIarah," a word which means bitter. From thence 
onward to the south uuti! they came to Klim, a i)lace still 
bearing that nanie. Then they came into the peninsula of 
Sinai, near one of the arms of the lied Sea. ^\'e are told by 
this writer that "in the original Hebrew the name found in 
the scriptures and translated 'Bed Sea,' has no suchsignili- 
cation." This may be true, but it cannot be denied that what 
we call the Bed Sea is meant. It <loes not prove that the 
account given in the Bible is less worthy of credence because 
the Hebrew name means "a reedy sea, a sea of shallows, 
water-iilant-s and bogs. " Nor is (he argument worthy of our 
notice becau.sc what is now called the sea of Serbonis is a 
reedy sea, such as answers to the Hebrew name translated as 
the Bed Sea. The words used in the Bible mean the Arai)ian 
Gulf, or Bed Sea of our day, which is sometimes called "the 



Egyiitiau Sea." "The tongue of the Egyptian Sea," (Isaiah 
xi., 15) does not mean the Serbonian bog, but the Bed Sea, 
In the tenth chapter of Isaiah and twenty-sixth verse, the 
word sea sta~ds alone, but the context makes known what sea 
is meant: "As his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up 
after the manner of Egypt." The seventh, ninth and twenty- 
second verses of the one hundred and sixth Psalm show that 
the Arabian Gulf, or the Bed Sea, is meant. PsaJms cxxxvi. , 
13-] 5, shows that the sea was "divided into i)arts," and 
Pharaoh and his hosts were overthrown in the Bed Sea. 

All the arguments of this writer are to endeavor to prove 
that no miracle was wrought. He tries to show that the hosts 
of the Egyptians were destroyed by natural means. He 
suggests that "a great wave from the Mediterranean forced 
the army of Pharaoh into a bog. ' ' To quote the words of this 
writer, who is not willing to admit the truth of the Biljlical 
account, but hardly ventures to deny it in whole, he sug- 
gests that "the Almighty had perhaps brought about the 
safety of the fugitives and the destruction of the pursuers by 
natural means — as by a great wave from the ^Mediterranean 
forcing the army into the bog." "We are told that "Dr. 
Brugseh maintains that his account is strictly Biblical," etc.; 
and then this self-elected commentator on the writings of 
[Moses glides off into eulogies of the labors of Dr. Brugseh 
for proving that the route chosen by IMoses, and described by 
Dr. Brugseh, is the only route that will accord with the 
Biblical names and the facts of geography. 

Now it is very considerate of this writer to admit that the 
.Vlmighty ;jc)7(((j).s caused a great wave from the Mediterranean 
to drown Pharaoh and his hosts; and he is equally cautious to 
tell us it was done by natural means. Why the Mediterranean 
should be calm just at that particular time when the children 
of Israel were crossing the Bed Sea, and just afterwards, when 
Pharaoh and his hosts were jiassing along, it should suddenly 
overleap its bounds and drown Pharaoh and his men, this 
\TOter does not explain, except thatpe;7«yM the Almighty had 
brought it about by natural means. 

To us, who are Latter-day Saints, and who have faith in the 
Almir;hty, and who know that He works by natural means, 
all this false reasoning is extremely childish. God is cajiable 
of working miracles if He chooses to do so. If He coidd 
cause the waters of the Mediterranean Sea to rise as a wave, 
and drown Pharaoh and his hosts, why could He not cause the 
waters of the Bed Sea to rise and destroy them? Either would 
be done by natural means. 

The Bible tells ns that Moses "stretched out his hand over 
the sea; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong 
cast wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the 
waters were divided." The natural means used are clearly 
jiointed out by JMoses, who also gave the honor of the great 
deliverance wrought for Israel to the Lord who causoil it. 

Dr. Brugseh tells us a very interesting fact, which is not 
generally known, in rcforciu'c to this Pharaoh. He saj's: 

"Mineptah's reign and his place of burial are not mentioned 
ill the monuments" of Egypt. The song of Moses may 
explain the reason why this happened — such a very unusual 
thing among the Egyptian kings. 'J'his king perished, and 
his army jierishcd with him. Surh an event was not likely to 
lie chronicled by (he scribes. Had he been successful it would 
jicrhaps have been otherwi.sc. But Jfoses says: "Pharaoh's 
chariots and his hosts hath lie" (the Lord) "cast into the sea: 
his chosen captains also are drowricil in (he lied Sea. The 
d(^|iths have covered Ihciii: (hey sank iiilu the Imltum as a 
stone."

JOURNEY OF A MISSIONARY. 



BY LLEWELLYN HAKRIS 



THIXKING that an account of luy journey from Escalante 
to the San Juan Aalley and from there to Sunset, Arizona, 
would be interesting to the readers of the Instrlx'TOR, I feel 
it my duty to give it. 

I left my home at E>calante on the ll4th of Fehuary, ISSO, 
and on the L'Cth crossed the Colorado River at Hall's Ferry. 
On the 1st of ^[arch I overtook Brother Silas Smith's company 
at the lakes, thirty miles from the Coloraili River. I traveled 
with them for thiry miles to the Clay Hill, where there was 
about eight days' work to be done before the company could 
resume their journey. Accordingly, I set out the next mori- 
ing afier my arrival at the Clay Hill, in company with three 
other brethren, for the purpose of cxjiloring the road in advance 
of the. company. I traveled with them for two days, and, 
as they did uot intend to go any further in the same direction, 
I had to start out alone for the San Juan Valley. The next 
day alter I left them I came to a forest of cedar trees, some 
forty miles in extent. In these cedars the snow was very 
deep. On account of this it took me six duys after I left the 
three brethren to reach the San Juan River On arriving 
near the river it began to snow. For protection fruui the 
storm, I camped for the night in a large cave. 

The next day I had to swim my pack-animals across the 
river four times, and my riding horse had to swim some dis- 
tance with me on his back. In crossing, all my clothing and 
blankets got wet, and I had to sleep in the wet blankets for 
two nights, as it snowed so much that I could not dry them 
On the 10th of March I arrived at Brother James Davis' 
ranch. I stayed there until the ISth, when I set out for 
Farmington, seventy miles uj) the river. On the 20th 1 had 
the misfortune to have part of my clothing and a little money 
stolen from me by a j)arfy of renegade Indians. 1 had to 
travel all night on two different occasions to keep the Indians 
from stealing nij- horses. 

On the 21 St I arrived at F.irmington, where I found six 
families of Gentiles. Having lost all my money, and only 
l)avinir flour enough to last me one day, and knowing I had to 
travel one hundred and twentj'-five miles from here before I 
was likely to get any more, I tried at four houses to trade a 
blanket for .«ome flour. I did not .succeed in getting any, but 
was in-uitel at every house by the occuj)ants. They accused 
the Saints of furnishing arms for the Indians to fight the 
settlers with. 

Not licing able to obtain any fl )ur, I concluded to start on 
my journey with the little I had lefr, which was only three 
pints. I traveled about twenty miles that day and campcl 
for the niL'ht. I a.-kcd the Lord to cause the flour to hold out 
for the jiiiiraoy. 3[y prayer was answered. For three davs 
my flour did not diminish, althouirh I u-e 1 all I wanfe 1. On 
th-; fourth day it diminished a little; but that evening I came 
to a camp of three Americans and three Spaniards, who were 
trading with the Indians. They treated me very kindly and 
gave me some flour and bacon for my journey. 

I have had manj' opportunities of preaching the go.spcl 
while on this journey. On the 2sth of March, whi(-h was 
Sunday, I stayed with a pany of railroad emidoye.s. They 



'^-■P 



treated me kindly, and I preached to them in the evening by 
one of their camp fires. They all listened very attentively to 
what I said. 

On the first of April I arrived at St. Joseph, on the Little 
Colorado, and was received in a very kindly manner by the 
brethren. On the 3rd I arrived at Sunset, where I was 
received by Brother Lot Smith and the Saints of that place. 
They are trying to fit me out with such things as are necessary 
for my journey, as I have had the misfortune to lose a part of 
my outfit on the road. 

The Saints of Sunset are trying to do all the good they can, 
and to live their religion, and are working in the united order 
as far as it is in their power to do so. 

1 expect to start on the 12th iu~t. on the mission to which 
I will be assigned. I have passed through some trials and 
privations before my arrival at this place. But I am glad 
to be counted worthy to suffer for the gospel's sake; and my 
prayer is that I may be able to dj good on this mission, and 
brine manv to a knowledge of the truth. 



KINDNESS TO ANIMALS. 



BY .JAMES HARDY. 



*'.V righteous man is merciful to his l>east.*' 

^\ rE are taught to be kind and merciful to our dumb 
' ' animals, by the will of God made known to us in the 
Bible. The Jewish Sabbath was instituted not merely for 
the advantage of man, but also that of his domesticated 
cattle, that the ox and the horse might rest as well as man. 

The Jewish laws forbade plowing with an ox and ass together, 
for the obvious reason that, as they were unequal in their 
strength, the labor suited to one would be grievous to the 
other. The same law says, "If thou meet thine enemy's ox, 
or his ass, going astray, thou shalt surelj' bring it back 
to him again. If thou .see the ox or the horse of him that 
hateth thee, lying under his burden, and would.st forbear to 
help him thou shalt surely hclj) with him." 

Nor was this ki'idne.ss to the lower animals limited to the 
body; it extended al.so to the mind, for it was forbidden to 
"muzzle" "the ox when he treadeth out the corn," so that 
the animal that was paticntl.v doing his allotted work might 
not be annoyed, ami vexed by seeing plenty of food under 
his feet, and yet be unable to satisfy his desire to partake 
of ii. 

Our Lord and IMaster, Jesus Christ, has taught us that 
even dumb creatures, that we regard as of little account, are 
under His providential care, for He says to His dosciples, in 
His beautiful sermon on the mount, ",'\.re not five sparrows 
si>ld for two farthintrs, and not one of them is forgotten by 
Him. Behold the f iwls of the air, for they sow not, neither 
do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet our heavenly Father 
feedeth them." 

It should be our duty to be kind to these inferior animals. 



EsERfiv will do anything that can be done in the world; and 
no talents, uo circumstances, no opportuaitics, will make a 
too-legged animal a man without it. 



Cheap persons will stand upon ceremony, because there is no 
other ground, but to the ereat of the earth we need no intro- 
duction, nor do they need any to us.

/7^^^:^^.\ UK fiftieth Annual Conference of the 
ClPir/j^CwLj^ Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
'* ^j.J Saints, which convened in this eit}' on the 
,*'^' Cth inst., was a most interesting occasion. 
.J Tlic tliousands of Saints wlio assembled 
;.<• enjoyed a rich treat in the ins]iired teach- 
n( (■ ings of the servants of God. The instruc- 
^"^ ,.J tions and admonitions given were ealcu- 
' H ^ lated to insjiire the Saints with renewed 
r faith in the promises of the Almighty, and a 
, , ,^'A( deterniination to live nearer to Ilim than here- 
(C^^^A ^ toforc. They were reminded, too, of the abun- 
(<^ji^^i " dant blessings which the Lord had bestowed 
_^ [f^^ ujion them .«ince the organization of the Church, 

..^'.'\.^ and the deliverances lie had wi'ought out for them, 
'^•NSvi V 'i"J made to feel that lie required something of them 
'"/jV^ in return. The duties of the Saints towards each 
other were also clearly pointed out. An example of 
the charity that ought to be extended to the poor by those 
who are able to help them was given in the propo.sition by 
the council of the Apostles to remit half the indebtedness to 
the IVrpetual Emigration Fund, and half the delinquent 
tithing duo from those who are poor and yet worthy. This, 
added to the ]iroiiositioii to donate to the poor one thousand 
good milch cows and five thousand sheep, should cause the 
hearts of the i)oor to swell with gratitude. It should also 
imluce those to whom jioor people are in bondage for debts, 
incurred in various ways, to relieve them so far as they con- 
sistently can of that indebtedness, and make their licarts glail 
with a prospect of freedom. 

Sudi generous actions could not be otjierwise than pleasing 
to the Almighty, and those who can and will do so ma.v be 
a.ssure<l that lie will reward them (or it. According to the 
inspired writer, '"[Ic that hath jiity upon the jioor lendcth 
luito the Lonl; and that which he hath given will He jiay him 
aL'ain." 




OX the evening of the .'ith inst. the Mutual Im])rovement 
A.-isociations of tlic Salt Jiake Stake of Zion held their 
general quarterly meeting in the 1 4th Ward As.sembly Jtooms. 
A part of the business of the meeting consisted of making a 
detailed report of the funds collected in this Stake (as also 
what was donated by jiersons or societies outside of the Stake) 
for the erection of a moiuiment to the memory of the late 
Elder Joseph Standing. As previously stated in our columns, 
subseriiitions for this jmrpose have lx;en taken up in this 
Stake by the Improvement Associations; and with a view to 
extending the i>rivilcgc of heli)ing to all, no one i)erson has 
been iillowed to ilonate more than t\V(Mity-five cents. The 
report .showed tliat nearly three hundred dollars had been 
already collected for this purpose, and a ninnber of associa- 
ation.s had not yet made full return.-i. It is hoped that a 
sufficient sum will be collected to i)ay for the erection of 
a substantial, aj-propriate monument and an iron fence lo 
surround it. Apostle-* I''. |). Hichard.s ]5rigliam Vo\uig, 



Josejih F. Smith and !Moses Thatcher were present at the 
meeting, and, with their approval, Brothers T. B. Lewis, W. 
C. IMorris, Rudgar Clawson, J. W. Summerhays and R. B. 
Young were selected as a committee to arrange for and super- 
intend the construction of the monument. Their names were 
then presented to the meeting and unanimously sustained. 
It is i^robable that work ui>on the monument will soon be 
commenced. We trust that when it is completed it will be 
such as to commemorate in an appropriate manner the death 
of our martyred brother, and the universal esteem in which 
his memory is held by the Saints. Ajijiropos to this subject 
we may introduce the following lines, written 

TO THE MEMORY OF JOSEPH STANDING. 



BY A. X. jr. 



Let us honor the name of the martyr, 
31ay his memory be green in our hearts; 

He died in defense of the gospel, 
In that power which the gospel imparts. 

He was steadfast and true to his calling, 

He was faithful to trutli and to God, 
He was found, when his nrmor was shining. 

In the path which his Master had trod. 

He was brave when, with Rudger, his comrade. 

He met with the merciless foe. 
Not men, but "devils incarnate," 

Whose hearts no compassion could know. 

The hour was now come, and the moment 
When their lives on the altar were laid. 

"DosistI" was the last word of Joseph — 
A flash, and the hero was dead! 

"What a test to the faith of young Rudger, 
•When his fellow Uy dead at his feet. 

With the black-hearted fiends still around him, 
"Who thirsted their work to complete! 

They were one in their lives, nor were parted 
"When the terrible deed had been done; 

"He shall sleep with the Saints, and the faithful 
Shall see that in death we were one." 

Rn saying, young Rudder determined 

(With what care and devotion 'twas done) 

To escort the remains of his comrade. 
That the parents might look on their son. 

'That the Saints hero in Zion might honor 

His name, as in thousands they met 
To show that his cause was theirs also, 
That his memory they ne'er could forget. 

He was clothed in the robes of the Priesthood, 

And laid in his peaceful retreat, 
To arise in the great resurrection 

A martyr in victory complete. 

Let our monument toll of his virtues, 

His devotion to God and to man. 
How hi.s blood stains the name of this nation, 

As only a martyr's blood can. 

Farewell, .Joseph Standing, 'tis only 

A sj)eek in eternity's span 
Till we meet with the Saints and the martyrs 

Who have fought, who have conquer'd and won. 



WirKN a true genius appeareth in the world, you may know 
him by this iiifailihle sign, that the dunces are all in confeder- 
acy against him.

THE ^VINE PRESS. 



FROM very earty times the juice of the grape has been 
used as a beverage. Two thousand three hundred and 
fifty years before the Christian era we read that Noah made 
wine. The Egyptians ascribed the invention to Osiris, whose 
worship was instituted more than two thousand years before 
Christ. The Greeks and other nations of antiquity considered 
that to Bacchus belonged the honor of inventing the wine 
press and wine making. The figure of speech used in the 
scriptures alluding to the wine press shows that the method 
of treading out the juice of the grape was well known. The 
picture shows the simplicity of the contrivance. The weight of 
the body of each person engaged in pressing the grapes is 
supported by the cords so that the fruit can be trodden on 
and crushed. The liberated juice flowing into a vessel to be 
fermented. 

Some ancient people mixed the juice of the grape 
with sea water, asafo^tida and even tar, to flavor the 
wine. 

The Jews highly esteemed the wines of Lebanon and 
Helbon; the Greeks those of Lesbos and other islands of the 
archipelago; the Romans had their favorite wines. That known 
as the Falernian wine was very famous. The art of making 
wine continued to be practiced in a very primitive way until 
within the last century or two when the modern class of wines 
were introduced. Sack or sherry, from a town named 
Xeres, in Spain, became very 
famous. Gradually the practice 
of merely treading out the juice 
of the vine and pressing out the 
remainder of that delicious fluid 
gave place to raisin wines and 
wine qualified with brandy. In 
our day it is very difficult, 
perhaps impossibile, to obtain 
pure imported wine. That was 
one of the reasons the "Word 
of Wisdom" was given, and that 
water is used by us in the sacra- 
ment. There is one great truth 
that may be borne in mind by all of us: whatever is of real 
benefit to us as nourishment for the body is found in thegrap'; 
i I self; so that, though we cantot get pure wine, we can obtsnu 
the same elements of life that exist in that beverage by eating 
the grapes or drinking the juice that is pressed from them. 
The kings of many ancient nations kept a great officer of state 
who pressed the juice of the grape into the cup and handed 
it to the king. 




M. jNI. I. A. 



SUGGESTION,? FOR THE FUTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE 
Y. M. M. I. A., BY THE COUNCIL OF THE APOSTLES. 




AGENEi'vAL meeting of th<ise interested in Young Men's 
Mutual Iinprovenicnt As.sociationswas held in the Assem- 
bly Ilall, in this city, on the evening of the (Jth inst. After 
the opening exercises. President Taylor stated that the council 
of the Apostles had considered the propriety of organizing a 
general suijcrintendency of the Ycjung Men's ^lutual Tniprove- 
ment Associations in the Church, and defining their sphere, 
that there might be no conHict bi'twcen these (irganizations 
and tho.sc of the priesthood. With this objeta in view, a 
series of suggestions had been prepared to be read at this 
meeting. He then hacl the follciwing rcail: 



1. — "This institution must not interfere with the Priesthood, 
or any of its members; but each individual member must be 
subject to the Quorum of which he may be a member, and to 
the regularly organized authorities of the Stake with which 
he is associated. 

2. — "Every Stake organization to be under the authority of 
the Priesthood in that Stake, and to have for its superin- 
tendent a High Priest, selected by the President of the Stake 
and his counselors, sanctioned by the High Council of the 
Stake, and voted for and sustained by the Stake Conference, 
and the associations of the Stake. 

3. — "This Stake superintendent may call two or more persons 
to his assistance, who may or may not be High Priests; they 
shall be known as assistants or counselors, and shall be 
approved by the President of the Stake and his counselors, 
sanctioned by the High Council of the Stake, and sustained 
Ijy the vote of the Stake Conference, and the associations of 
the Stake. 

4. — "The Twelve may appoint a general superintendent from 
time to time, who may, when convenient, be one of their 
council, who shall have the general superintendence of the 
Stake organizations. 

' 5. — "The general superintendent may direct the action of all 
the Stake superintendents, and preside over all the officers of 
the associations, in all the Stakes; and may have two of the 
Twelve, when convenient, as counselors, and they may call 
upon such assistants, secretaries and other help as may be 
required. The whole to be under the general superintendence 
of the Twelve, as the Presidency. 

"The editor of the Contribator and the paper, to be subject 
to, and under the general direction of the superintendent and 
counsel. 

' 'AH books used in libraries for the use of the associations to be 
inspected and approved by the general superintendent and his 
counsel, and all works containing skeptical, immoral or 
improper doctrines, or principles, to be excluded therefrom. 

6. — "The general superintendent and counsel to make 
arrangements for the jiurchase of books for the libraries, and 
other purposes, on the best possible terms; and all profits 
arising therefrom, after paying the necessary expenses, to go 
for the use and benefit of the Stake associations who may 
order such books. 

"It must be understood that these organizations are not 
formed as a separate or distinct Church organization, or body 
of Priesthood, but for the mutual improvement of the mem- 
bers and all connected therewith." 

After the reading of the foregoing, President Taylor again 
addressed the assembly, explaining the reason for each sugges- 
tion, commending wliat had already been accomplished by the 
associations, and exjiressing bright hopes fi)r their future. 
He then nominated Elder Wilford Wuodruft" fiir general 
superintendent, and Elders Joseph l'\ Smith and Closes 
Thatcher for his counselors. The names were voted upim and 
su.staincd unanimously. 

The suggestions were also accepted by vote, and I'urther 
encouraging remarks were made upon the subject of mutual 
impniveuierit.

Betircfii Father and So7i. 

Sox — Father, why don't you like boys to smoke tobacco? 
Father — Do you think tobacco is a nice thing? 
S. — No, I do not. I think it is very nasty. But the boys who 
smoke it seem to like it. 
F. — Tobacco is not nice, and I hope you will never like it. 
S. — I hope I shall not. 

F. — Xobody likes it when he first uses it, and it often makes 
boys and men sick until they get used to it. 

S. — Yes, I saw it make "Will Jones sick the first time he smoked. 
O! how sick be was! I wonder he ever touched it again. 

F. — Tobacco is a very unhealtliy thing to use, either to smoke 
it, or to chew it, or to use it as snuft". It is of a poisonous nature. 

S. — Then why do people use it? 

F.— That is hard to tell. Boys generally learn from each other 
to smoke it, and they think they are very brave and manly when 
they can smoke it. 

8. — I should think they are very foolish. 

F. — That is precisely what they arc, and for many reasons. 

S. — I can't think how people can like it. 

F. — T question whether ihey do really like it. But it is one of 
those things which is very difficult for a person to do without 
after he gets used to taking it regularly. ^^len and boys become 
complete slaves to tohacco, when they take to it. They are not 
its master, but it is their master. 

S. — That seems strange, that a little bit of nasty, stinking 
tobacco should be master of a man. 

F. — Tt is strange, but it is true, and (hat is one of the bad things 
connected with tobacco. When people have formed the habit of 
using it. the habit sticks to them through life in almost every 
- case, growing stronger and stronger and increasing its power 
over them until they are perfectly miserable if they are deprived 
of tobacco for only a day. 

S. — It seems to me there are a good many reasons whj- boys 
should not smoke tobacco nor use it in any way. 

F. — Yes, there are. It is a habit that they find they cannot 
get rid of, not one in a hundred of them. 

S. — I can believe that. It is very strange that jieojile .-ire so 
willing to yield to a power that holds them enslaved as with 
chains of iron. 

F. — It is very strange, indeed, and it reminds one of the old 
proverb. "W)io would be free, himself must strike the blow." 
But in this slavery to tobacco, the victims are first free, and so 
remain until they voluntarilj' forge their own fetters, put Iheir 
own bodies and souls into them, and then rivet them on .so 
securely that it is very seldom they ever get free from them again. 

S.^There can hardly be greater folly than that. 

F. — True: but boys do not seem to Knd it out until too late. 
Many of them are so foolish tliat they glory in the slavery to 
which they deliberately subje(-t themselves. 

S. — Is not tobacco had for other reasons than because using it 
is an enslaving habit? 

F. — Yes. It injures the bealtli. vitiates the taste, and degrades 
men. It is. moreover, a most filthy thing to have in the month 
or nose in any form whatever. No tobacco smoker or chewer 
has a pleasant smell about him. He always stinks. 

8. — Yes, I can smell tobacco smokers as soon as they come 
any where near, and wh'n they come close to me the smell 
almost t.'iUes my breath. 

F. — Then there is another peculiarity about tobacco smokers 
or chewer''. They are ainnnit the most selfish i)eople in the 
world. Pniokers. generally, will smoke anywhere, poisoning 
the air whether other per.|,le like it or not. Chewers will spit all 
over carpets and sloven, and render themselves odious beyond 
expres-ion to people who take a pride in keeping their houses 
clean. 

S.— Well, I do not thitik I shall ever smoke or chew tobacco. 

F.— I hope you will not. I trust you will have better sense 
tlian to form such nn obj< ctionable luibil. But it is the beginnings 



that you should be careful to avoid. A boy or man who never 
begins to smoke or chew will never be enslaved by either of 
those bad habits. On the other hand, if a boy begins to smoke 
or chew, there are ten chances to one that he will never leave off 
the habit after he has become a man, no matter how much he 
may wish to do so.

PAPER FOR THE YOUNG SAINTS IN DENMARK- 
WORK PROGRESSING IN SCANDINAVIA. 



sP 



Copenhagen, Dexmakk, 

:\Iarch 'iOth, 188(1. 
Gfnrr/e Q. Ciiiiiion, 

Deak Brother: — I forward you this day by mail the 
first four numbers of "Ungdommens Raadgiver," a monthly 
paper published in the interest of our Sunday schools and the 
young Latter-day Saints in the Scandinavian mission. The first 
number of this little sheet was published January 1st, 1880. Wo 
have taken the liberty to translate your interesting little work, 
"Jly First Mission " into Danish, and are now publishing it by 
chapters in our little paper. We have also, as you will see in 
No. 4, commenced "Questions and Answers for the Sunday 
.Schools" which is almost a translation from what you published 
in the Juvenile Instructor a few years ago under the title 
"Sunday Lessons for Little Learners," on the history of Joseph 
Smith. We are also inserting a chmnoloay of the most impor- 
tant events which has transpired in the Church from A. D. 18U0 
to ]88(). This I am making up with great care, a.ssisted partly 
l)v the chronology published by F. D. Richards in his "Com- 
jiendiuni," and for latter years I get my information from the 
back volumes of the "Jlillennial Star." The piper is otherwise 
intended for short leading articles treating upon the duties of 
young Latter-day Saints in these lands, correspondence from 
merahersof Mutual Improvement Associations, scientific treatises, 
etc. The paper has already about 1,'2(N) subscribers. 

Our Sunday school in this city is doing, well and the children 
are progressing most favorably. As far as practicable we are 
adopting the same system of teaching as is used in the schools 
in Zion. Besides the school in this city we have also a Sabbath 
srdiool in Aarhus, Jutland, numbering '2(> pupils; another one in 
Cbristiania, Norway, which has ti'2 pupils and members, and a 
small one of the same kind in Aalborg. 

Wo organized a Y. M. M. I. A. in this city November T.lth, 
1S79, which now has about In members. AVe hold regular 
meetings twice a month, sneaking mostly upon gospel principles 
and the history of the Church. A similar organization was 
effected in Christiania, August iith, 18711, which now has :'.;) 
members and holds regular meetings once a week. Still another 
one was organized in Aarhus, Pehuary l:', 1880, now numbering 
'2'2 members; meetings are held there every other week. When 
President Wilhelmsen visits the various conferences in the spring 
he expects to establish similar organizations \a as nuiny of the 
other conferences as may lie deemed practicable. 

A Female Relief Society, which now has over l:!0 members, 
was organized in this city November '20th, 1870; it has already 
aeeomplished a groat deal of good, both temporally and spiritually. 
The sick have been visited, the weak in faith encouraged and 
.•everal poor and needy assisted. An organization of the same 
kiml was effi-cted in Aarhus, I'\;buary I lib, issi), which now has 
upwards of .")0 members. 

Altogether, the work of God is progressing in these lands. The 
brethren who are here from Zi(m are good and noble men, who 
are working with zeal and integrity for the salvation of mankind. 
Many have been baptized of late in various parts of the mission. 
In this city alone '2'i were added to the Church by baptism during 
the last quarter.

GATHERING- FIGS IN ITALY 



A LTHOUGH indigenous to Asia and Barbary, the fig has 
-^~*- been so long and to extensively cultivated in Italy that it 
may be considered native, on the ground of the Irishman's 
remark that he had been a native of a certain country for ten 
years. The season joins handsin October with the vi'ndemmia, 
or vintage; but it begins in Ai'gust, owing to a curious system 
of cult'ire. Early in that month as you sit gasping under the 
noonday sun, you hear a wild, eerie strain in minor key, which 
goes echoing up and down the slopes with intense mourn- 
fulness. It is the song of the fig gatherers, tossed back from 
hill-side to bill-side, and from tree-top to tree-top, as they 
squirm through the branches and ''oil the fruit." The tribe is 
nomadic, and appears and disappears like the wandering 
harvesters of France, no one knowing whence they come or 
whither they go. Late in June the masserit: are rented to 
them, they paying a given .sum to the proprietor, anl'taking 
po.ssession of all the fruit, beginning with the figs and ending 
with the last waxen cluster of grajies. Rude huts, thatched 
with straw, are built by the proprietor in all his orchards, and 
there these gypsy-like creatures live with their families — 
stalwart, fierce-looking men, swarthy, dark-eyed women, and 
active, lithe young rascals of children. Sometimes they sup- 
plement their narrow quarters with a rasged tent — three 
sticks crosswise and a kettle in the crotch constitute a kitchen. 
Beds are an unknown luxury. Indeed, tliey seem never to 
lay aside their clothing, and day and night they patrol the 
orchards with a long gun and a fierce dog, the very sight of 
which is enough to destroy one's appetite for those particular 
figs. 

The process of forcing the fruit is at once begun, and for 
many day.s that wild, sweet song, into whose wierd melo 1y the 
spirit of their homeless life seems to have entered, is heard 
from tree to tree, in call and response as far a? the faintest 
adumbration of sound cau reach. The methods of forcing 
the ripening are curious. In one a wad of cotton is dipped 
in olive oil and gently rubbed on the flower end of the fig. 
Fig by fig is thu'! treated, and eight days thereafter the fruit is 
ready for market, where it commands a high price as a priiDnn: 
Another method consists in gathering in the spring the half- 
formed fruit, which is strung on ropes as we string dried fruit. 
These ropes or garlands are thrown over the branches of the 
tree and allowed to decay under the burning sun. Life out of 

death. An insect is born from this decay which pierces the 
growing fig and induces rapid maturity — or, shall we call it 
early decay? maturity being only that precious zenith of 
existence which must inevitably be followed by decline. Leav- 
ing such premature sweetness to the epicure, one may well bo 
content to wait the result of nature's unhurried process. The 
fig, when perfectly ripe, exudes a slow drop of honey-sweet 
juice at the nether end, which never falls but hangs there, 
a standing temptation to bees and men. When fresh picked, 
at this stage, the fig is indescribably luscious, with a rich 
flavor entirely lost in the dried fruit. Svkctol. 



WHITE \VAX OF CHINA. 




TllK company of fools may at first make us smile, but at last 
.■cr fails to render us melancholy. 



IN the Keen-chang district of the province of Szechuen there 
grows in abundance the Ugnstrum hiciJiim, an evergreen 
tree with pointed leaves, on the twigs of which myriads of 
insects spread themselves, like a brownish film, in the Spring 
of each year. Presently the .surface of the twigs becomes 
incrusted with a white waxy substance secreted by the insects, 
and it increases in quantity until the latter part of August, 
when the twigs are cut off and boiled in water. During this 
period the wax rising to the surface is skimmed off, and is 
then melted and allowed to cool in deep pans. By one of 
those curious accidents which have done so much to increase 
the knowledge of mankind, it was discovered that by trans- 
porting the insects bred in Keen-chang to the less congenial 
climate of Kea-ting Fu, in the north of the province, the 
amount of wax produced was vastly increase!. No people 
more readily discern a commercial advantage, or more speedily 
take advantage of one when unincumbered with political 
considerations, than the Chinese; and this singular effuct of 
removing the insects from a congenial climate to one so uncon- 
genial as to prevent their breeding was eagerly taken advantage 
of by the Sze-chuen traders. Travelers by night on the high 
road between Keen-chang and Kea-ting Fa may meet in the 
Spring of the year hundreds of wax merchants, each carrying 
his load of female insects, big with young, on their way to the 
wax farms in Kea-ting Fu. The journey is rough and long, 
and a fortnight's sun would precipitate the hatching, which 
should take place after the females have been attached to the 
trees. To the unscientific eyes of the Chinam n the round, 
pea-like female appears to be nothing more than an egg, and 
this belief is the more excusable since the birth of the young 
is the signal for the death of the parent, of whose previous 
existence there remains only as evidence an outer shell or hm-^k. 
Six or seven of these prolific mothers are wrapped in a palm 
leaf and tied to a branch of the lii/inftntm lucididn. In a few 
days swarms of infinitesimally small insects creep forth and 
cluster on the twigs of the tree, where they fulfill their mission 
and perish with its accomplishment in the boiling pot each 
August. Baron Richthofen considers the value of the annual 
crop to be on an average upwards of $3,000,000: and during 
last year there was exported from the one port of Hankow 
upwards of $400,000 worth of it. 



Fair Pl.^y. — Once, when T wa* returning from Ireland 
(says Roland Hill), I found my.self annoyed by the reproliate 
conduct of the captain and mate, who were both sadly given 
to the scandalous habit of swearing, First, the captain swore 
at the mate; then the mate swore at the captain; then they 
swore at the wind; when I called to them for fair play. 

"Stop! stop!" said I, "If you please, gcritleuien, let us 
have fair play; it's my turn now." 

"At what is it your turn, pray?'' said the ciptain. 

"At swearing," I replied. 

Well, they waited and w.iited, U'ltil their patience was 
exhausted, and then wanted me to make haste and take my 
turn. I told them, however, that I hi 1 a right io take my own 
time, and swear at my own convenience. 

To this the ca;)tiiii replie i, with a laugh, "Perhaps you 
don't moan to take your turn?" 

"Pardon mo, (captain,,' I answered, "but I do, as sooa as I 
can find the good of doing so." 

I did not hear another oatii on the voyage.

THE ART OF WAR A^NIONG THE 
NEPHITES. 



BY G. P.. 



[Conftnncd.) 

IT does not apDear, so far as can be gathered from the record, 
that anj' very great improvements, either in the system of 
fortification, the style of defensive armor, or the manufacture 
of their weapons, was made by the Nephite commanders who 
lived after the days of Moroni. 

There is another kind of defensive clothing, beside plate 
armor, mentioned as being worn by the ancient American 
warriors. It consisted of very "thick clothing," * possibly 
made of cotton or woolen cloth, thickly padded. Moroni 
uniformed some of his troops in this manner when Lc first took 
command of the Nephite armies, (B. C. 74) and the next 
year the Lamanites followed his example and not only prepared 
themselves with shields and breast plates, but also "with 
garments of .skins; yea, very thick garment;; to cover their 
nakedness." t 

The various enemies that the Nephite armie ■ had to meet, 
from time to time, on the field of battle— Lamanites, Amulon- 
ites, Amalckites, Zoramites, Gadianton robbers, etc. — were 
very diflFerently equipped for their bloody work. Those who 
had dissented from the Nephites naturally held to ihe same 
tactics, used the same arms, and protected their bodies with 
the same armor as the jieople to whom they had turned trait- 
ors. With the original Lamanites it was different. At first 
when they came against the Nephites they were clothed with 
"a short skin girdle about the loins and their heads shaven; 
and their skill was in the bow and the cimeter and axe." 
The dissenters, while armed and erpiipped like the Ne]ihites, 
set a mark upon them-elves by which they might he known 
and distinguishel on the battle field. lu doing this they 
unconsciously fulfilled the word of the Lord to their father^. 
Thus, the followers of Amlici, the would-be king, marked 
themselves with red in their foreheads after the manner of 
the Lanjanites, though tlioy did not shave their heads as did 
the direct descendants of liuman. (B. C. 87). + 

The description of the Gadianton robbers, as they ajjpeared 
when prepared for war (A. D. IS), is a very terrible one: i 
"they were girded about after the manner of robbers; and 
they had a lamb-skin about thoir loins, and they were dyed in 
blood, and their heads were .shorn, and they had head-jilates 
upon them: and great and terrible was the appearance of the 
armies of Giddianhi, beciuso of their armor, and because of 
their being dyed in blood." 

The forces of both races appear to have been coni|)Osed 
very largely, if not entirely, of infantry. We have failed to 
notice any i)assages that give a definite assurance that either 
cavalry or war chariots were use! in their campaigns. 

Like nearly all rude or .semi-civilized races, the Lamanites 
depended on the .strength of numbers and brute force for victory 
in the open field. Tliey massed their troops in solid bodies 
and with wild cries rushed to the assault in the hope of 
bearing down all resistance by their superior numbers, as in 
almost every war they greatly outnumbered the Nejdiites. 
Indeed it is doubtful if even the last-named i)eop1e used much 
.scientific strategy iirevious to the days of ^loroui; before this 
time it was a hand-to-hand conflict, wherein the Nephites,

„ .. " ', 4^1. 



though fewer in numbers, had many advantages over their 
half-naked foes, by reason of superior weapons and defensive 
armor, and, above all, through the blessing and guidance of 
the Lord. 

In the year B. C. 72 the armies of Moroni drove the 
Lamanites out of that portion of the cast wilderness bordering 
on the land of Zarahemla into their own lands. The country 
of the Nephites was called the land of Zarahemla, that of 
the Lamanites the land of Nephi. They were divided by the 
great wilderness; to the north lay Zarahemla, to the south 
Nephi. The northern line or boundary of the latter country 
ran "in a strait cour.se from the sea east to the west." The 
Lamanites having been driven out of those portions of the 
wilderness north of the dividing line, colonies of Nephites 
\ were sent to occupy the country and build cities on their 
southern border, even to the Atlantic coast. To protect 
the new settlers, Moroni placed troops all along this line and 
caused them to erect fortifications * for the better defense of 
the frontier. This fortified line ran from the west sea (the 
Pacific Ocean) by the head of the river Sidon (the Magdalena) 
eastward along the Northern edge of the wilderness. Some 
of the readers of the Book of Mormon have imagined this 
line of defense to have been one continuous rampart or wall — 
after the style of the great wall of China— reaching from 
ocean to ocean, and on this surmise have argued that the 
completion of such an immense work, in a few years • was 
an impossibility to a people of the limited numerical strength 
of the Nephites. To get over this difficulty of their own 
creation they have resorted to various theories, inconsistent 
with the geographical details, with regard to its locality, on 
purpose to shorten its distance to what tjicy deemed a reason- 
able length, possible for the Nephites to have built in a few 
years. The writer of this paper holds the opinion that the 
Book of Mormon conveys no such idea, it simply states that 
Moroni erected fortifications along this line; or, as he views 
it, Moroni took advantage of the natural features of the 
country, its wide rivers, far-stretching swamps and ranges 
of high mountains, and built fortifications at evea'y point where 
the Lamanites could find ingress, such as at the fords of the 
rivers and the passes between the mountains. He there 
stationed bodies of troops .sufficiently strong to hold their po.sts 
and, if necessary, defend the surrounding country. This 
system of defense would be more powerful and effective than 
an artificial wall; high mountains and deep rivers largely 
taking the place of earthworks, masonry and heavy timbers. 
A number of years later (B. 0. 34) the Lamanites having 
temporarily driven the Nephites from the southern continent, 
.Moronihah, the son of Moroni, fortified the Isthmus of 
I'anama from sea lo sea, t and in this way prevented the 
Lamanites from pushing yet further north. This dcfcn.sive 
line was again fortifiel by Mormon (A. D. 300) iu the last 
great series of wars between the two races. J 



The surest way of governing, both in a luivate family and a 
kingdom, is for a husband and a prince .sometimes to drop 
their prerogative. 



What is tbo first business of one who studies philosophy? 
To part with self-conceit. l''or it is impossible for any one 
lo begin to learn what he thinks he already knows.

TUS 



iCondiiiicd.) 

HAVING seen tlie arras delivered up and bid his family 
farewell, Joseph once uioro turned his face towards 
Carthage. 

When opposite the Sla'^onie Hall he said to the brethren 
there: 

"Boys, if I don't come back talce care of yourselves; I am 
going like a lamb to the slaughter." 

As they passed his farm, he took a goo 1 look at it; and 
after they had passed it, he turned round several times to look 
again. This caused some of the company to make remarks, 
when Joseph said: 

"If some of you had got such a farm, and knew yo>i would 
not see it any more, you would want to take a good look at it for 
the last time." 

Before he and the company reashed Carthage he received 
a letter from H. T. Reid, Esq., and one also from James W. 
Woods, Esq., lawyers. In their letters they informed him 
■what they needed in the shape of evidence; and Mr. Woods 
stated that, from an interview he had had with Governor 
Ford, Joseph could rely with the utmost saft>ty on his (the 
governor's) protection. About midnight, Joseph and the 
company arrived at Cirthage. While passing the public 
square, many of the troops, especially the Carthas-e Greys, 
made use of a great many dreadful expressions and threats. 
These were heard by the governor and hundreds of others. 
They threatened to shoot Joseph then, and said that he had 
seen the last of Nauvoo, and they whooped, yelled and 
cursed, threw their guns over their heads backwards in a curve 
so a? to have the bayonets stick in the ground, and acted 
like madmen. 

When the governor heard these expressions, he put his 
head out of the window of the house where he was stopping, 
and, in a fsiwning manner, said: 

"Gentlemen, I know your great anxiety to see l\rr. Smith, 
which is natural enough, but it is quite too late to-night for you 
to have that opportunity; but I assure you, gentlemen, you 
shall have that privilege to-morrow morning, as I will cause him 
to pass before the trocps upon the square, and I now wish you, 
with this a-surance, quietly and peaceably to rwturn to your 
quarters." 

At the hotel where Governor Ford was stopping, and where 
Joseph and his friends had put up, there was a company of 
apostates quartered. One of them, John A. Hicks (formerly 
the President of the Elders' Quorum) told Bro. C. H. Whee- 
]ock that it was determined by him>elf. the Law.s, the Higbees, 
the Fosters, Joseph H. Jackson, and many others, to shed 
the blood of Joseph whether he was cleared by the law or not. 
He talked as freely upon the subject, as though he was s|ieak- 
iog upon the most common occurrence of hi.s life. Bro. Whce- 
lock told Ford what llicks had said; but he treated it with 
perfect indiffeienco, and sufFircd Hicks and his associates to' 
go free and make all the arrangements tliey wanted to cairy 
out their murderous plans. At the same time he had pledged 
his own faith and the faith of the Siale of Illinois, that Jo.-cph 
and Hyrum Smith and the other iirisoners should be itrotocted 
from personal violence, and should have a fair and impartial 



trial, if they would sui'render themselves to be dealt with 
according to law. He said this repeatedly, also, to Joseph's 
lawyers. Having made these pledges, he should have taken 
every measure to protect Joseph and Hyrum and the other 
brethren who had come to Carthage and given themselves 
up, and if any man had threatened violence, as Hicks did) 
he should have had him arrested. But such a course required 
nerve and decision and a determination to have justice main- 
tained, of which qualities Ford was utterly destitute. 

After Joseph and Hyrum had been arrested on a charge of 
treason the morning after they reached Carthage, the former 
on the oath of Agustine Spencer, the latter on that of Henry 
0. Norton, both apostates. Ford ordered all the troops to form 
a hollow square on the public ground near the Court House. 
His speech to them was delivered from an old fable, on which 
he mounted. He endorsed all the rumors which had been in 
circulation about Joseph and the Saints, and fanned the fire of 
hatred which was already burning in the hearts of his hearers 
against them. He stated that although Joseph and Hyrum 
were dangerous men in the community, and guilty of all that 
they might have alleged against them, still they were in the 
hands of the law, which must have its course. After this he 
came to where Joseph was stopping and invited him to walk 
with him through the troops. Joseph solicited a few moments 
private conversation with him; but this he refused. He felt, 
so ashamed and mean as he did so that he could not look up; 
he kept his eyes on his shoes. Joseph and Hyrum then 
walked through the crowd with Brigadier-General Miner R. 
Deming and Dr. Richards to General Deming's quarters. 
{To he Continued.)

SCRIPTURAL KNTa:\rA. 



HY .1. .T. C. 



First name the mount where God descended and commandments 

gave. 
.\nd then the mount that will diviile when lie shall come to save; 
Thirdly a son of .Incoh old, whose sons the pric'sthood bore; 
Then a son of the damsel who did elenn in days of yore; 
Now name a .Jewish prophet who Klijah's coming told; 
.Vnothcrone who feared the Lord, but was not very bold; 
I.a^tly, a captive Israelite who rebuilt .lerusalem's w.iU. 
The initials make a wise man's name: let all beware his fall.

WE give our readers in this number an engraving of two

from the American Blue Jay. The latter is a smaller bird 
than the European, has a longer tail and the tuft of feathers 
on the back of the head is more prominent and rises to a point.

THIS metal is more curious than useful as a metal. It is the 
color of silver, lighter than water, can be welded at a tem- 
perature below the heat of the human bod.v, mells at a heat 
much less than that of boiling water, takes fire if thrown upon 
ice or water, and can bo kept in the metallic state only by be- 
ing preserved in certain fluids (as naptha) which contain no 
oxj'gen. So we see, children, that as a metal it is never likely 
to bo of great value either for ornament, like gold and silver, or 
for use, as iron and other metals. 

But when we want some amusement in the lecture room, it 
becomes quite an object of interest. Only think of setting 
water on fire! It is, however, the metal which burns (oxidizes) 
and also the hydrogen of the water; for, when the metal appro- 
priates the oxygen, the water, (or ice, which is water in a solid 
form) ceases to be water, it is decomposed, the hydrogen is set 
free. We have then a new substance formed, potash (KO) the 
protoxide of potassium. This is called "a fixed alkali," which 
means that it is not a volatile alkali like ammonia, capable of 
passing away as a gas. It is also called "potash" because it is 
prepared for common purposes by evaporating in iron ]mts the 
lye formed from wood as/ies. The "concentrated lye," so fa- 
miliar to us all, is potash and water in a seuii-erybtaline state, 
its formula, KO plus HO, means Kalzium and Oxygen (potash) 
and water. 

In one form or other, this powerful alkali is of the highest 
importance to man, useful in the arts, in the growth of vegeta- 
tion and in forming the tissues of animal bodies. But it is no 
found in nature either in the metallic state nor as a caustic sub- 
stance, and it is well for us; for vegetable matter would be con- 
sumed and animals destroyed. Potassium and Sodium (also 
o" which we shall have to speak) are two metals, which, in 
combination with oxygen, form two basic substances, soluble 
in water, having great affinity for carbonic acid; with this acid, 
the poweiful corrosive qualities are toned down without being 
destroyed. The active qualities remain the same, but they act 
with less energy. Thus the carbonates of these powerful bases 
are found, the carbonates of potash and soda. 

We are familiar with the bi-carbonate of soda used in bread- 
making, and carbonate of potassa, is very similar, this is one 
of the constituents of land plants, as soda is of marine plants, 
as sea-weeds, fuci, etc. Whcin wheat straw and other vegeta- 
ble matter is burned, carbonate of potass, phosphate of potass, 
bydrochlorate of potass, sulphate of potass, etc. , are found in 
the ashes. It is curious to seek after the origin of this ele- 
ment potassium, as well as to examine it in all it? varied forms. 
It is then found to be a component part of the rocks of which 
our oldest mountains are formed. 1 hese rocks are decomposed 
by the air and water; hard as they are, some of the parts arc 
soluble in water and some are not. The potass is soluble in 
water, especially when charged with carbonic acid; and, in this 
way, the alkaline matter finds its way to the tiny rootlets of 
plants. Animals cat plants, and, in this way, potash is intro 
duced into the blood. Although the proportion of potass is 
small, being but a very s-mall percentago of even the ashes of 
plants, and found in a still less proportion in that of animals 
it is considered of the very liighest iuiportancc to the health 
that that proportion should be maintained. This is why pot 



assa is given as a medicine; although it may be that when 
man has attained to higher knowledge, fruits of various kinds 
will be used by him to supply the various salts used as reme- 
dies for the different maladies to which he is subject. Vege- 
tables also are used by man as food, many of which are called 
"potash plants" on account of the comparatively large propor-, 
tion of potash salts they contain; much could he said about the 
improper proportion of some of these plants for food, this pro- 
perly belongs to our subject, for cooking ia truly a chemical 
process. All salts soluble in water, and those are the only 
useful ones to man, unless his digestive powers can make them 
soluble, these are almost always washed away or boiled out of 
vegetables. Cabbage, for instance, is soalced in water instead 
of being cleansed by rinsing, this must remove a large propor- 
tion of the most soluble matter; then they are boiled and the 
less soluble ia given out and thrown away. Sometimes it is 
given to the hogs, and the harsh, indigestible woody fiber is 
used by man as food. Now those very salts thrown away ore 
the food; and would, if retained, make the woody fiber itself 
digestible. In the next article, we will examine potassium in 
some of its combinations,

TO BE! OK. TO SEE3Vn. 



Thehe was once a little rosebush that wished to be beautiful. 
All day long it stood in a sunny, south window, and stretched 
its fair, green leaves to the liglit. 

"0 dear!" it sighed, "if I only had some sweet, pink blos- 
soms, then everyone would like me and praise me. O dear!" 

But she was a lazy little rosebush, not at all in earnest about 
being beautiful. If she had been, she would have searched 
carefully among the dark mould at her feet, until she found 
something to begin a rosebud with — ever so little a dot of a bud 
to begin with. Then she would have loved the liny thing, and 
nursed it and coaxed it till it grew a fair and shapely bud; and 
when the old sun found out about it, he would have sent an 
exquisite artist millions of miles to paint its folded petals, and 
at last there would softly unfold a beautiful flower, that would 
be the joy of all who saw it. 

But the little tree had no idea of going to work — it just stood 
still and sighed, "0 dear! I wish I had some blossoms." 

One day its mistress heard its sighs, and she fastened upon 
it some artificial buds and flowers. Then the little vain bush 
held up its head quite proud and satisfied. 

The people who passed by the window, when they caught 
the first glimpse of the rosebush, used to exclaim, "0 how 
beautiful !" but when they came near, and saw that the blos- 
soms were only make-believe, pinned-on blossoms, they cried, 
"0 fie!" and turned away with contempt. 

There was once a little girl wished to be beautiful. She 
wished to have everyone love and admire her; but she did not 
try to obtain the wisdom that would win their admiration, or 
the graces of heart and life that would win their love. That 
was too much trouble and too much self-denial. 

There must be a great deal of lowly, patient, pains-taking 
work, deep down in the heart, before the blossoms of a beauti- 
ful character can unfold themselves in life and action. The 
little girl did not like this kind of work, so she gave up tryini,' 
to be beautiful, and was content only to wrwi beautiful. So her 
beauty was only on the outside. She had fine dresses, with 
flounces and ribbons and bows, and she was careful to be very 
polite, and practice elegant manners, fche could dance and 
play and sing, and had many other pleasant acceniplishmenta. 

VVhen people first saw this young girl, they exclaimed, "0 
how lovely!" but when they came nearer, and saw her real 
character to be selfish and deceitful, they found that all her at- 
tractions were only pinned-on roses, and thev turned away in 
contemj-t from a character so fair but false. — [.bWecft-rZ.

DE. CART WRIGHT. 

[CONTINUED.] 

TO the very last hour of his life, his brain was teeming with 
new designs. He went down to Dover, in his eightieth year 
for warm sea-bathing, and put Iiis bathman up to a way of 
pumping up the water that saved him the wages of two men; 
and almost the day before his death, ho wrote an elaborate 
statement of a new model he had discovered of working the 
steam-engine. Moved by an irresistible impul.^e to promote 
the "public weal," he truly fulfilled the resolution he expressed 
in verse: 

"Witli mind unwearied, still will I engage, 

In spite of failing vigor and of age, 

Nor quit the combat till I quit the stage." 

In 1808 lie was rewarded by Parliament for his invention of 
the power-loom, and the losses it brought upon him, by a grant 
of £10,000. He died in October, 1823. 



ROBERT PEEL. 

CARTWRIGHT'S power loom was afterwards taken in hand 
and greatly improved by other ingenious persons — mechanics 
and weavers. "The names of many clever mechanics, " says a 
writer in the Quarterly Review, "who contributed to advance 
it, step by step, through tailure and disappointment, have long 
been forgotten. Some broke their hearts over their projects 
when apparently on the eve of success. No one was more in- 
defatigable in his endeavors to overcome the difficulties of the 
contrivance than William RadclifFc, a manufacturer at Mellor, 
near Manchester, whose invention of the dressing-machine was 
an important step in advance. With the assistance of an in 
genious young weaver in his employment, named Johnson, he 
also brought out the dandy-loom, which effects almost all that 
can be done for the hand-loom as to motion. Radcliife was 
not, however, successful as a manufacturer; he exhausted his 
means in experiments, of which his contemporaries and suc- 
cessors were to derive the benefit; and after expending im- 
mense labor, and a considerable fortune in his improvements, 
he died in poverty in Manchester only a few years ago." 

To the Peel family the cotton manufacture is greatly in- 
debted for its progress. Robert Peel, the founder of the fami- 
ly, developed the plan of printing calico, and his successors per- 
fected it in a variety of ways. While occupied as a small far- 
mer near Blackburn, he gave a great deal of attention to the 
subject, and made a great many experiments. One day, when 
sketching a pattern on the back of a pewter dinner-plate, the 
idea occurred to him that il color were rubbed upon the design, 
an impression might be printed off it upon calico. He tested 
the plan at once. Filling in the pattern with color on the back 
of the plate, and placing a piece of calico over it, he passed it 
through a mangle, and was delighted with seeing the calico come 
out duly printed. This was his first essay in calico-printing; 
and he soon worked out the idea, patented it, and starting as 
a calico printer, succeeded so well, that he gave up the farm 
and devoted hims.'lf entirely to that business. His sons suc- 
ceeded him; and the Peel family, divided into numerous firms, 
became one of the chief pillars of the cotton manufacture. 

To such perfection has calico-printing now been brought that 
a mile of calico can be printed in an hour, or three cotton 



article, that one firm alone— that of Hoyle— turns out in a 
year more than 10,000 miles of it, or more than sufficient to 
measure the diameter of our planet. 

It was a favorite saying of old Robert Peel, in regard to the 
importance of commercial wealth in a national point of view, 
that "the gains of individuals were small compared with the 
national gains arising from trade;" and there can be no doubt 
that the success of the cotton trade has contributed es- 
sentially to the present affluence and prosperity of the 
United Kingdom. It has placed cheap and comfortable cloth- 
ing within the reach of all, and provided well-paid employment 
for multitudes of people; and the growth of population to 
which it has led, and consequent increase in the consumption 
of the various necessaries and luxuries of life, have given stim- 
ulus to all the other branches of industry and commerce. From 
one of the most miserable provinces in the land, Lancashire 
has grown to be one of the most prosperous. Within a hun- 
dred and fifty years, the population has increased tenfold, and 
land has risen to fifty times its value for agricultural, and sev- 
enty times for manufacturing purposes. From an insignificant 
country town and a little fishing village have sprung Manches- 
ter and Liverpool; and many other towns throughout the coun- 
try owe their existence to the same source. These are the 
great monuments to the achievements of Arkwright, Crompton, 
Peel, and the other captains of industry who wrought this 
mighty change, and the best trophies of their genius and en- 
terprise.

THE funeral cortege was first preceded by a number of men 
carrying fruits and other kinds of edibles, costly or other- 
wise, as the bereaved family could afford. Then came the mu- 
sic — the beating of drums and other instruments, producing a 
strange medley of sounds; after which came the corpse, fol- 
lowed by a number of mourners. When the funeral procession 
had arrived at the cemetery, the body was placed in a kind of 
Temple, the band played, and the priests, sitting behind the 
coffin, received the presents of the party. After some incom- 
prehensible ceremonies, during which the people were talking 
and appearing as merry and cheerful as at a marriage feast, the 
body was taken out of the Temple and carried to the grave, 
followed only by a few of the mourners, the main portion re- 
maining behind. At the grave, we saw no ceremony whatever; 
tbe coffin was laid upon the ground and opened, and the toes 
of the deceased were tied to the end of the coffin to keep them 
steady. The body had no shroud upon it, — in f\xct, nothing 
but a strip of rag around the loins. The grave was only about 
three feet deep. The body was taken out of the cofEn and let 
down into the sepulcher by hand. The wife of the deceased 
then threw a little earth over the feet to keep the ghost of her 
husband from appearing to her. 

Leaving the grave, the cortege repaired to a kind of saloon, 
situated in the graveyard, where a feast was prepared. There 
the mourners laughed and talked and smoked — the women 
among the rest smoking their cigars — and acted for all the 
world as though they were at a Christmas festival. 

We made a present to the poor widow and returned with a 

rant light to 



smcere desirs that it might please God soon to g 
dresses in a minute; and so extensive is the production of that these strange people.

GDE<»KGE Q. CATHTlVOrf , : EXSITOK. 

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1869. 

EiDiTOi^.iJ^L th:oxjc3-s:ts. 

E told you something, in the last number, 
about the books of the olden time before 
printing was discovered. There is an is- 
land in the north of Europe, tho people of 
which are noted for their intelligence, 
where, even at this day, they are badly 
supplied with printed books. But so eager 
are they for knowledge that, when they can 
borrow a book, they will copy it rather than 
be without it. The island is named Iceland. 
By one of its native writers, it is called "a 
barren i.=land in a frozen sea;" yet he adds: "in 
spite of its natural disadvantages, it was long 
the chosen abode of literature and science, af- 
_ an honorable shelter to men of letters, when 
the rest of Northern Europe was devastated by pira- 
cy and sunk in barbarism." 
*/> /j ^ » They have a custom there which we think a very 
excellent one, and one that might be practiced with benefit in 
many of our families in this Teriitory. Being so far north, 
Iceland's winter evenings are very long; but the people con- 
trive, when they are at home, to pass them very pleasantly. 
Between three and four o'clock a lamp is hung up in the prin- 
cipal apartment, which answers the double purpose of bedroom 
and and sitting roomThen all the members of the family take 
their stations, with their work in their hands, on their respec- 
tive beds, all of which face each other. The master and mis- 
tress, together with the children, or other relations, occupy the 
beds at the inner end of the room; the rest are filled by the ser- 
vants. 

As soon as the work is begun, one of the family, selected for 
the purpose, takes a seat near the lamp, and commences to 
read. The reader is often interrupted, either by the head, or 
some of the more intelligent members of the family, who make 
remarks on various parts of the subject read. Questions are 
also proposed, with a view to exercise the ingenuity of the 
children and servants. In some bouses-, traditional histories 
are repeated by such as have got them by heart. There are 
men who travel from farm to farm, and gain their livelihood 
during the winter by reciting these histories. 

By taking this course, the people become very well-informed, 
and a taste for knowledge is fostered in the young. This meth- 
od has many advantages. Where there is a circle of hearers, 
the more intelligent can impart much that is interesting and 
valuable to the others. Reading of this character calls it out. 
What is read and conversed upon in this manner, also, makes. 
a much deeper and more lasting impression upon the mind 
than it would if read to one's self. Besides, the necessary work 
can be carried on; all are occupied. Opening the ears to listen 
does not prevent the hands from working, and one reader can 
make a large company hear. 

The Icelanders thoroughly master the few books which they 
have within reach, and it is said that, through their practice in 
copying books, the most of them write a hand almost equal in 
beauty to copperplate. Our readers can learn a lesson from 
the people of Iceland. They can learn that a people can be- 



come more intelligent by thoroughly mastering a few books 
than by carelessly reading a great number. Every boy and 
girl should, before commencing to read a book, satisfy them- 
selves that it is worth reading, then if it is, they should read 
it closely and attentively and comprehend its contents. If one 
reading will not accomplish this, then read it a second time; 
and, in fact, it should not be laid aside until tho subject on 
which it treats is fully understood. Such reading will be profit- 
able, far more so than the superficial reading of a much greater 
number of books. There is one kind of book and periodical 
which no young person should ever read, and that is a work of 
fiction. Such should not be read, as they burden the mind with 
useless rubbish, injure the memory and spoil the taste for his- 
torical or scientific reading. 



WE expect our readers and /riends have wondered at the 
delay in issuing the last numbers of this volume. They 
are five or six weeks behind date. We will explain the cause 
of this, and trust it will bn satisfactory. It has been our inten- 
tion to issue the forthcoming volume in a new dress. In a pa- 
per, such as the JnVENiLE Instructor is, the type should be 
clear and distinct. Its popularity with juveniles depends on 
this. Children, of all other readers, should have clear, plain 
reading. Our intention in the first place was to send east for 
type, as we have been in the habit of doing. But, before we 
did so, an opportunity presented itself of getting the type cast 
here. To make the necessary arrangements for a foundry for 
casting type, required time; yet our desire to have the Juven- 
ile Instructor appear in a new dress of home-manufacture 
prompted us to take this time. This is the reason of our delay 
in issuing these numbers. We did not wish too long a period 
to elapse between the publication of the last number of volume 
four and the first of volume five. 

We have felt confident that if we could only succeed in get- 
ting the type manufactured here, our subscribers would pardon 
our lack of punctuality. We trust that this explanation 
will enable them to do so. 



The Blind Beggar's Dog. — A blind beggar used to be 
led through the streets of Rome by a middle-sized dog. This 
dog, besides leading his master in such a manner as to pro- 
tect him from all danger, learned to distinguish not only the 
streets, but also the houses where his master was accustomed 
to receive alms. Whenever the animal came to any of the 
streets with which he was well acquainted, he would not leave 
it till a call had been made at c, ery house where his master 
was accustomed to be succcsi^fi:! in his petitions. 

When the beggar began to a^k alms, the dog being wearied, 
lay down to rest. But the master was no sooner served or re- 
fused, than the dog spoutancoiisiy and without any word or 
sign from his master, ro^e aud proceeded to the other houces 
where the beggar was accu;r; iiied to receive some gratui'j'. 
When a half-penny was thru\v:i from a wind, w, such was the 
sagacity and attention of the dog, that he went about in quest 
of it, lifted it from the ground with his mouth, and put it into 
his master's liLit. Even when bread was thrown down, the 
animal would not taste it unless lie received a portion of it 
from bis master's hand. — [PhiiosopJiy of Natural Hislorxj. 

"The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou heareth the 
sound thereof, but canst not tell whence itcometh, and whither 
itgoeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit." — Johniii.8. 

"In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of 
God through the Spirit. "Eph. ii. 22.

THE accompanying sketch represents one of the numerous 
classes of religious beggars that infest India called Fakirs, 
(pronounced Fakeers), and are confined to the male sex. They 
are to be found in all parts of Hindostan, and are more or less 
reverenced and even worshiped by the people, on whom, by 
their assumed holiness, they re?dily impose and obtain an easy 
living. It is difficult to conceive how these repulsive human 
beings, whose strange dress and appearance are illustrated in 
our engraving, should receive the respect and esteem so univer- 
sally accorded to them. * 

In some few instances, these Fakirs attain to great wealth; 
and have their disciples and temples, and go about in state on 
elephants and on horseback, collecting their alms and contribu- 
tions. In other and more favorable instances, they become Fakirs 
by taking a vow to reform their lives and devote themselves to 
poverty and self-denial, with a view to 
their salvation; and to this end, in their 
ignorance, they impose on themselves all 
kinds of conceivable pains and penalties, 
which are in general disgusting and pain- 
ful to witness. 

Thus some will hold up an arm till it 
withers; close a hand until the nails grow 
through it; or stand on one leg till the 
limbs become stiffened, emaciated and 
incurably diseased; thus punishing and 
subjecting themselves for stated periods 
or for life, to the greatest sufferings they 
can possibly inflict; in their blind and 
mistaken zeal, maiming and destroying, 
instead of honoring and preserving the 
bodies and powers our Heavenly Father 
has bestowed on man for His service and 
glory. 

Some, again, bind themselves to per- 
petual silence, or go about almost or alto- 
gether naked, with their bodies smeared 
with mud and ashes, objects of filth, and 
the fruits of heathen superstition. The 
forms of the tortures to which they subject themselves are 
almost innumerable. 

The great majority of Fakirs are composed of poor, ignor- 
ant and degraded creatures, who, being too lazy to work, take 
to that idle hfe in preference to labor, and, under the garb of 
holiness, gratify their evil propensities at the expense of the 
deluded people, who, having been sunk for thousands of years 
in idolatrous superstitions and ignorance, are almost universal- 
ly subjected to their impositions and vile influences. 

This is particularly the case with the women, who are more 
easily imposed upon, being kept in utter ignorance of all know- 
ledge that can tend to expand and enlighten their minds. They 
become their most zealous devotees and upholders of all the 
superstitions and abominations of degraded heathenism. For 
many long ages, religious mendicants have thus preyed on the 
people of India, being a part of its heathen systems which the 
fuUnefS of the gospel of Christ can alone dispel, when in God's 
due time they are ready to receive it, which they were not 
when our missionaries offered it to them seme sixteen years ago. 
But the day of their redemption may not be far off; as under 
the beneficial rule of the British, knowledge is spreading 
through the land, breaking up the barriers of caste and dispens- 
ing the dark clouds of error that have so long enveloped the 




land, so that idolatry is beginning to lose its hold on the people 
and the superstitious submission to its priestcraft by the na- 
tives, who have been brought into contact with the European 
residents there has, in a great measure, been lessened or ex- 
ploded. 

The influence the Fakirs have so long exercised over the 
people for evil has been materially lessened, for, in many places 
and by certain classes, they are now despised and neglected; 
nor are they allowed to go about unhee3ed in a state ot nudity 
in the crowded thoroughfares as they for merly did, as the fol- 
lowing anecdote will show: 

One of these Fakirs having trespassed on the grounds of one 
of the European judges ol Patna, a large city some two or three 
hundred miles northwest of Calcutta, the judge ordered him to 
be tied up and flogged; which was done by the native dei end- 
ents. After having received h's punishment and been laughed 
at and twitted by his countrymen who were present, the Fakir 
gave the following reason for his treat- 
ment, which, many of his listeners being 
believers in the transmigration of souls, 
answered his purpose: "Do you not 
know," he said, "why the judge has done 
this? In his former life, he was my ass, 
when I used to flog and treat him un- 
mercifully; and he is now only paying me 
off, which I deserve for my former cruelty." 
By thus excusing himself, he obtained his 
revenge and lowered the judge in the 
eyes of the people. 

We mention this as an instance of the 
low estimation in which Fakirs are now 
held in comparison with what they were 
formerly, then public flagellation would 
not have been endured, much less execu- 
ted by the people. 

India is one of the finest countries in 
the world, inexhaustibly rich and aboun- 
ding in every production that can tend to 
the support and comfort of the human 
race; and is capable of sustaining a dense 
population; but it has ever been a dark 
idolatrous land, inhabited for the last three thousand years by 
races of men who knew not the living and true God, whose long- 
suffering and mercies they have continuously abused through 
a long and dreary night of gross darkness, during which ignor- 
ance, superstition, idolatry and priestcraft and the Devil have 
had full sway. 

But this state of things cannot endure for ever, seeing that 
the kingdoms of this world are eventually to become the 
kingdoms of our God and of His Christ, when He will 
gather together all things in one whether in heaven or on earth, 
as spoken of by all the holy prophets from the beginning of the 
world; in His good providence, God has now commenced His 
great work which will not fail to be accomplished in His own 
due time, God is gathering His people together to serve Him 
and enjoy His blessings through obedience to His holy will, 
first made known to us in those days through His prophet Jos- 
eph Smith, whom He raised up and called for this purpose. 
Through him, as His honored instrument. He has established 
His holy priesthood on the earth, never more to be destroyed; 
by which He will ever rule and fulfill all His good pleasure for 
the final salvation of mankind. 



"Hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit 
which he hath given us."— 1 John iii. 24.

YEN after the lapse of nearly twentj'-five 
years, one can not read the history of the 
last days of Joseph without a feeling of in- 
dignation rising towards the miserable 
creature who acted, at that time, as Gov- 
ernor of the State. Thomas Ford is a 
^ name that will live in history side by side 
with that of PoNTius Pilate, lie was an 
imbecile. A more pliant, short-sighted, 
weak tool could not have been found, to suit the 
purposes of the mob, if the country had been 
searched. lie was full of pompous littleness, and 
the leaders of the mob humored his weak conceit. 
By this means, they used him, and he was more 
serviceable to them, without knowing their planSj than 
, if they had explained them to him. 

On the 23 J of June, the day after Joseph had writ- 
Hi^ ten to him, he sent a long letter addressed to the 
i\Iayor and City Council of the City of Nauvoo. It is 
only necessary to read his letter to learn the man's capacity. 
He had no more real comprehension of the issues at stake be- 
tween the Saints and the mob than if he had been a child. 
The letter plainly showed that the task of oontroling or check- 
ing the mob was beyond his power. Ihe charges in his letter 
were based upon the most vile falsehoods. He both scolded 
and entreated the Mayor and City Council; but one of the chief 
points in his letter was that they should submit themselves to 
be "arrested by the same constable, by virtue of the same war- 
rant, and be tried by the same magistrate" who had issued the 
summons for their arrest on the charge of destroying the press 
of the Nauvoo Expodtor. Nothing short of th?.t, he said, 
would vindicate the dignity of the law and allay the "just ex- 
citement" of the people. 

In Number 22 of this volume, you recollect, we told you that 
a constable came to Nauvoo with a writ to arrest Joseph and 
the other brethren for abating the Kauroo E.cpositor as a nui- 
sance. This constable was very insolent, and Joseph and the 
other brethren knew that, if they went to Carthage, the mob 
was ready to commit any act of violence against theu', even to 
killing them. They, therefore, petitioned the municipal court 
of Nauvoo for a writ of /lahcus corpus, and were tried and ac- 
quitted by that court. Acting under the advice of Judge 
Thomas, the Circuit Judge, they afterwards submitted once 
more to arrest on the charge of riot in destroying the Nauvoo 
E.i-posi'ur prcfs. Tiiey were tried before President Daniel II. 
Wells, who, at that time, however, was not in ihe Church, but 
was a Justice of the Peace; and after a long trial, they were 
again ac<iuittcd. It would have been as reasonable in Ford to 
have invited Joseph and the brethren to go out to Carthage 
and lay their heads on the block to be chopped off, as to say 
that they must go out there, aRer being twice tried and aciiuii- 
tcd, to be tried again. The mob at Carthage was like a wild 
beast that clamored for blood. It wanted victims, and victims 
it would liave, if urging Ford to entrap them, would secure 
ihem. Already it licked its lips in anticipalijn of the Jior 
id feast. Joseph and the other brethien would have made 



the mob a nice meal; but they knew this, and were deterinined 
to keep away. 

Joseph wrote a reply to Ford's letter that must have made 
the latter's cheeks tingle with shame when he read it, that is, 
if he had any shame left in him. lie controverted every one 
of Ford's statements and arguments. He said how it could be 
possible for them to be tried constitutionally by the same mag- 
istrate who first issued the writ, they could not see; for the con- 
stitution expressly says no man shall twice be put in jeopardy 
of life and limb for the same offence. But, notwithstanding 
this, he said, they would not hesitate to stand another trial, 
according to his wish, were it not that they were confident 
their lives would be in danger. He told Ford that he had 
promised them protection; but, "at the same time," said he, 
"you have expressed fears that you could not control the mob, 
in which case we are left to the mercy of the merciless." He 
told him further that writs were issued against them in various 
parts of the country, so that the mob might have the power to 
drag them from place to place and from court to court, till 
some blood-thirsty villain could find an opportunity to shoot 
them. Joseph closed his letter by saying that if anything 
wrong had been done on the part of himself and others, (yet 
he knew of nothing,) they would make all things right if the 
Government would give them the opportunity. And he en- 
treated the Governor to disperse the mob, and secure to him- 
self and friends their constitutional privileges, that their lives 
might not be endangered when they were en trial. 

But Governor Ford was deaf to all reason. He was sur- 
rounded by apostates and the worst enemies of the Saints. On 
his arrival at Carthage, he had ordered the entire mob into 
service. He heard their imprecations and their threats, and 
saw their violence and outrageous conduct; but instead of be- 
ing disgusted with them, they suited him. He adopted, as the 
truth, every lie and misrepresentation that the mob circulated. 
The delegates, whom he wished the Mayor and City Council 
of Nauvoo to send to him, he treated with great rudeness. 
When they attempted to make the necessary statements and 
explanations, he suffered them to be interrupted and insulted 
by the vile crew who were his companions. Even the commu- 
nications which they brought were read to him in the prtsenc; 
of these villains, who frequently interrupted the reading by 
their cursing!

Through Venezuela flows the great Orinoco river. It is 
sixteen hundred miles long, in some places three miles wide, 
and it waters a great extent of couiitry during the five months 
of its rising and overflow. It is sixty miles broad at its mouth, 
and the tide reaches to a distance of two hundrtd and fifty 
miles from the sea. This grand river, full of cascades and 
islands, rocks and rapids, finally sweeps at the base of the Par- 
ima Mountains. 

Among these mountains, tl.e river is said to take its rise, 
but the savages who live near its source, never allow a traveler 
to reach the spot. The country through which it flows is com- 
posed, for the most part, of sandy arid plain«, which are covered 
as though by magic, with verdure and blossom, when the rain 
falls. These fiat and unattractive portions of Venezuela are 
relieved by thick forests and hills. When the rivers overflow, 
they often make their way into the forests, attaining, some- 
times, a bight of thirty feet. 

Amid this beauty and grandeur, beside the river, in the for- 
est, and at the foot of a majestic mountain, dwells a melan- 
choly little widow. The rainy and tl e dry seasons are alike to 
her. She cares not for the bright-tinted leaves, the magnifi

times, on the higfest branches of the tall trees, catching the 
bright-winged m«h or butterfly, which flits in the twilight 
among the leavea or throws to the ground the luscious cocoa-

there are none tj sympathize with or comfort her. 

In contrast wih her mourning robe, her white 'hroat gleams

S CJTTEIE. 
^UR readtrs are doubtless many of them aware that, until a 
few yea] •! ago, when the practice was suppressed, it was the 
custom in lnilia,when a woman's husband died, to bury her along 
with the corpse of her husband. This cruel custom was called 
the Suttee, in instance of which is related by Captain Kemp, 
an oflSoer in (he service of the East India Company, who was an 
ej'e-witness pf the scene. The strange ceremony took place at 
Goudoripora, about twenty miles from Calcutta, in March, 1813, 
the victim being the widow of a young Hindoo officer, and only 
in her sixteenth year. She was persuaded by the priests to 
bury herself by the corpse, and all the entreaties of the Euro- 
pean residents could not shake her in her purpose. Her mother 
was urged to interpose, but superstition drowned her humanity, 
saying it was her daughter's own choice to follow the spirit of 
her husband. Next morning, the corpse was conveyed to the 
banks of the sacred river Ganges, where a circular grave, fit- 
teen feet in circumference and six in depth, was prepared. 
The dead man was placed in the bottom in a sitting posture, 
while the young widow stepped from among her iriends, and 
walking .slowly around the jiit, uttered in a wild manner the 
words "huree-bul, huree-bul," which were soon caught up by 
the crowd of bystanders, who echoed the cry in the same tones. 
The j'oung widow then walked seven times around the grave, 
and during a most breathless silence descended into it, sittting 
down behind the corpse with her face towards the dead man's 
back, her left arm entwined around iiis neck and her hand re- 
clining on his shoulder, while her right Land was raised over 
her head, the forefinger erect and moving in a circle, which it 
continued to do, while the grave was being filled up around the 
living and the dead. Soon lier body was entombed up to the 
chin, but her raised face continued visible and beamed with the 
same wrapped look and the same unearthly decision, while the 
earth rose higher and higlier till at last the face disappeared 
altogether. The lomded arm was covered, and one last look, 
as the sickened spectators turneii horror-stricken away, showed 
that the point of the finger was still erect and still turning 
round. 



For the Juvenile Instructor, 

J^ BTOJElir IPOS. BOYS. 




MANY of the boys and girls who have been born in this Ter- 
ritory have'llttle idea of the struggles which their parents 
have made that they might enjoy the benefits of a good educa- 
tion. If they could properly estimate those struggles, and 
knew the blessing which the numerous schools now in Utah 
place within their reach, many of them would Ptudy harder 
than they do when at school. I will tell j-ou a true story of a 
boy who gained a good education under difficulties such as most 
of my young friends know nothing about; and it may help to 
urge on those who are not diligent in their studies to be more 
attentive in the future. 

James was a poor boy. His father was dead, and his mother 
had to support him and his j'ounger sister by hard work. She 
could scarcely get bread enough for them. They lived in a 
country in Europe where many of the poor have little but rags 
to cover them, and where they have often to go hungry. 

James and his sister I ad many a time to go without break- 
fast or dinner, and often went supperless to bed, tliougli their 
mother worked nearly night and day, when she could get work, 
to procure food and clothing for them. 

James, when very young, showed a strong desire for learn- 
ing, and his mother was anxious that he should go to school, 
but she could not pay for it. By and by he got the privilege 
of going to a school as a free scholar. Often he had to bear 
the jibes of his school-fellows because he was so poorly clothed, 
for there are boys mean enough to taunt those who are not so 
well-dressed as themselves. Often, too, he had to go without 
food; and he had great difficulty in obtaining books; yet his 
poor mother did all she could to supply him. But James stud- 
ied hard, and, while very young, he used to watch the lines of 
care gathering on his mother's brow, and wish he was grown 
large enough to work for her. 

While yet a boy, he had progressed so well with his studies 
that he was employed as assistant teacher, by which means he 
was able to pay for the instruction he received. He was about 
sixteen years old when I first knew him, and was tall for his 
age. He had then been assistant teacher for some time. He 
was high spirited and anxious to earn means to help himself 
and his mother and sister. Yet he did not know what to com- 
mence working at, so that he could earn S3mcthing and still 
continue his studies; for he was as desirous as ever to acquire 
a good education. 

One day he saw a book-binder at work, and immediately de- 
cided to try book-binding; but he could not think of leaving 
school to apprentice himself to the business; and he had no 
tools and no money to buy any. He had energy, though, and 
perseverance, and determination. So he made some tools him- 
self, with the assistance of a kind blacksmith who furnished 
him with nuts and screws and a knife for his rough book-cut- 
ter. He first re-bound his school-books, taking them carefully 
asunder to learn the bookbinder's stitch; then he bound some 
books for scholars who were in the same school; and finally got 
books to bind from people around, for it was in acountiy place 
where he lived, and far from any town where a regular book- 
binder lived. 

By this means he obtained a little money and helped his 
mother so far as to buy his own clothes. He also bought som ; 
mathematical instruments, some books, and some chemical 
apparatus, for he was determined to beconje a learned 
man. Every minute he had to spare was devoted to acquiring 
some useful information. He learned to use earjienter's tools, 
until he was able to work as a house-carpenter. IJe also gained 
such an ac(|uaintance with bliu-ksniithing that he could go into 
his IVicnd's foi'ge and do any little job for himself which lie re- 
quired. But his books and chemistry were his chief delight

Before he was seventeen he became the teacher of a school 
of his own; and soon after was in a position to support his 
mother and assist his sister, whom he had educated at home, 
to a good situation. 

The last time I saw him, he was not quite twenty-one years 
of age, and he was on the point of sailing to America to try his 
fortune in the United States. His mother, who was in com- 
fortable circumstances through his labors, was to follow him 
with his sister, then grown to be a handsome and accomplished 
young woman. lie was, though a mere youth, a man of large 
and varied information. He had risen rapidly from one step to 
another, by his diligence, his perseverance and his knowledge, 
and was recognized hy all who knew him as a most promising 
young man before whom there was a bright future. That is 
over twenty years ago, and I have not seen him since, but I 
have heard of his success. We were warm friends, and it 
gi ieved us to part from each other; but he believed there was a 
greater future before him in America than in Europe, and he 
left his native land some time before I had determined to come 
to this country. 

If this were not a true story, I might say much more of that 
future to which James looked forward; but I cannot, because I 
do not know whether he is now living or dead. But a boy who 
will continue his studies faithfully through poverty and hun- 
ger, and who will not allow the jeers of rude boys at his poor, 
thread-bare clothes, to prevent him from continuing to drink 
in knowledge and increase his understanding, will not fail to 
make his mark in any country where education, perseverance 
and youthful energy are respected and encouraged. 

Will my young friends, who have parents that keep them 
cOTifortable, and who send them regularly to school, think of 
this young man, and the difficulties he had to contend with 
when they feel inclined to neglect their studies, or to pay more 
attention to pl.ny than to the instructions they receive?

The words of our language are derived from other tongues; 
but who could think what strange parentage some of them 
have. We find the word houdoir to be derived from the French 
word bonder, to pout, and parlor from parler, to speak or con- 
verse. So we see the difference between the parlor and a bou- 
doir. In the former, one looks for social amusement and pleasant 
conversation, but in a boudoir, one reasonable expects to be 
alone, or at least quiet. 

Then, there's the word supercilious Where do you think it 
comes from? From supercUium, the Latin for eyebrow, that 
feature being most employed in the exercise ef the sentiment. 
Sincere also has an obvious origin, since it comes from the Lat- 
in gine eerci, applied to honey freed from the mixture of wax. 

Locust comes from the Latin loco vstajis, burning or laying 
places waste. Cobweb is from the Dutch kopxebbe, kop mean- 
ing spider. Onion comes from the Latin uuio, meaning oneness. 
Cruise, to cross to and from, is from crux, the Latin for a cross. 

I'uny is from the French puis ne, literally, born since or 
after, junior. The word pony, as applied to a small horse, and 
puisne, designating a junior judge, have the same origin. 
Tiompcr, to deceive, gives our word trumpery. Easter gets 
its name from the Saxon goddess Eostre, whose festival waS 
celebrated about the time of the Passover, which latter feast 
has taken possession of the name. 

Herring is derived from the German licer, an army. Neat 
or horned cattle, is from the Anglo-Saxon hnitnn, to butt 
with the horn. Soldier comes from the French solde, pay. 



Comrade, formerly camerade, or' chambei-fellow, comes from 
the Latin camera,a chamber. Auction, fron the Latin augere, 
to increase. Havoc is an Anglo-Saxon wod meaning hawk. 
Our word "Cubit" comes from the Latin cihitus, an elbow.

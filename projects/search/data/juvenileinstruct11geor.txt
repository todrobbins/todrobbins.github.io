The mountain raven circling low, 

With measured wing glides past. 

The little birds that hop around

God gives those little birds His care; 

He fashioned them with skill, 
E'en as He made all things that are 

To serve His holy will. 

He says, nat even sparrows fall 

Unnoticed to the ground; 
And that our hairs are numbered all, 

His love does so abound.

AM0NC4 other subjects which we wish to lay he- 
fore our young readers is that of Biography, or the 
history of men and tl*eir lives and characters. We 
feel sure that every boy and girl in this Territory 
will take pleasure in reading about men and women 
who have made themselves famous in the world 
through their virtue and goodness. By reading 
Biography they can see the steps which men have 
taken to make themselves useful and great, and ob- 
tain many lessons by which they can profit. 

,^j,:.'-t in the list of great and distiiiguished men 
'''^' "Mte lived in our times, stands the name of 
.. . ,. .: SiMiTH. We expect out little readers have 
all heard of him, and know something respecting 
his life. He was born at Sharon, Windsor county, 
in the State of Vermont, on the 23d of December, 
1806. Had he lived until the present time he 
would have been .about sixty years of age. lie 
would not have been a very old man even now, for 
you know many men and women whu me smari 
tiud active who are much more thun sixtv \e:irs old. 
He was the fourth child of his p-.irents, he i'.iving 
two brothers and a sister older than himself. When 
he was about ten years of age his pnrents moved 
from Vermont to the town of Palmyra, in the State 
of Kew York. They were not wealthy, and were 
not able to give their children more than jtn ordi- 
nary common-school education. But they taught 
them to be moral, truthful and indnstrion.s and 
brought them up, to the be^t of their a.l)ility, in 
the fear of the Lord. 

Some little time after tlie ■ ■ a father 

and family to Palmyra the people in tlnir neiglilior- 



ers told the people that they were the fol- 
lowers of Jesus and his Apostles; at the 
same time they, themselves, quarrelled one with 
anotli&r about the doctrine of Jesus. One said 
that his church was right; and another said, not 
that church is not right; but ray church is; and 
thus they contended, each preacher- trying to ge, 
everybody to leave other churches and to join his. 
Of course this produced great confusion and strife. 
For when the preachers disputed^ the people could 
nut agree. Our readers who have been born and 
l)rought up hi the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints have never seen anything of this 
kind. They have never seen two or more preach- 
ers quarreling ^about their churches; one saying that 
his church was right, and another contradicting him 
and saying that his church was wrong. In this 
Territory the people do not contend about religion 
and about which is the right church. The truth 
which the Lord has revealed from heaven, by send- 



did not know what it was; he could not see his cm;- 
my ; he could only feel him. He did not know as much 
about the power and wickedness of Satan then as 
he did afterwards. But he did not give up; he ex- 
erted, all his powers, and he called upon God to de- 
liver him out of the power of thisencmv which had 
hold of him. 

At this moment of great alarm, he ?aw 
a pillar of light exactly over his head. It was 
much brighter than the sun, and it gradually came 
down until it rested upon him. When it appeared, 
he found himself free from the enemy which had 
held him bound. You can all think how happy he 
must have felt when that wicked power was driven 
away. As soon as the light rested upon him he saw 
two personages standing above him in the air. They 
had the form of men, yet their brightness and glory 
were far beyond that of the sun or anvthiiiff that 
we can see around us in this world. No man, 
therefore, caf\ tell another how beautiful and glori- 



ii.g his angels to speak with man, has stopped all ^^^^ ^j^^y Iq^j.^^. ^^ understawd this he must see 

their glory for himself, One of them called Joseph 
by name, and pointed to the other and said; 
"This is my. beloved Son, hear him."' Joseph had 
asked God for wisdom, and his prayer had been 
heard and was now answered. He had the glori- 
ous privilege of beholding the Father and the Son 
and of being taught respecting the gospel by its 
great Author.

contention, and united those who have obeyed it 
and made them one. But Josepli Smith did not 
have the privileges and advantages when he was a 
boy that the little boys who live here have. His 
parents did not know what your parents know, and 
they could not tell him what yonr parents can tell

this' time of great excitement Joseph 
thought deeply on the sul'Jeet of religion, and he 
became somewhat ut^easy respecting the course 
which he should take. rii> father's family believ- 
ed the Presljyterian faith, and his mother and three 
of his brothers and one lister joined thut Church.

and strife which he saw amnnu tfie.'^e preachers and 
their churches"^puzzled hini. I'iiis is not to be won- 
dered at, for he was very young, and did not have 
niiieii experience. But he believed tii" Cible; and 
knew that it eontained more of the woid.s of God 
than any otliei book that he could get. So he paid 
attention to thnl, and one day, while reading in the 
epititle of James, he met with the following words 
in the first chapter and fifth verse: ''If any of you 
lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth unto 
air men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall 
be given him." This passage of scripture came 
with great power to his heart. He knew that if 
any person needed wisdom from God, he did; for 
he could find no one who could tell him what he 
wanted to know. After thinking upon the subject, 
he came "to the conclusion that he wotdd do as 
James directs and ask of God. On a beauti- 
ful niorning, early in the Spring of the 
year eighteen hundred and twenty, when he was in 
his fifteenth year, he went into the woods alone to 
ask God for the wisdom which he wanted. In this

came away from Jerusalem about 2,400 years since.

have become so filthy, dark and degraded. In or- 
der to properly understand our story and to make 
it interesting to them, our little readers siiould ask 
their parents or teachers to show them where Jeru- 
salem is on the map, and then trace the course 
which we shall indicate to them from that place to 
ilie western coast of America. 

About six hundred years before Jesus Christ was 
born, there lived in Jerusalem a very good man, 
named Lchi, who feared God, prayed constantly to 
Him, and not only strove to keep His command- 
ments himself, bat taught his family to keep them 
also. 

. This man went out by himself one day into the 
fields and woods near Jerusalem tp pray. While 
{(raying very earnestly, the Lord appeared to him 
in a pillar of fire, which came and stood upon a rock 
before him. The Lord spoke to him out of this pil- 
lar of fire, and told him many things which made 
him fear and tremble exceedingly Lehi then went 
home to his house in Jerusalem, and, feeling weak in 
body because of the things he had seen and heard, 
he thi'few himself upon his bed to rest. While lying 
down, the Spirit of the Lord rested upon him and 
he saw the heavens opened and God sitting flpon 
His throne, surrounded by thousands of angels. 
One of these angels descended from heaven and 
came and talked with Lehi, telling him that, in con- 
sequence of the great wickedness of the Jews, the 
Lord was about to suffer the King of Babylon to 
come and destroy Jerusalem, kill a great many of 
the inhabitants and take the rest as captives to Ba- 
bylon. This was just before, what is called in his- 
tory, the Babylonish captivity took place. 

Many of our little readers would, doubtless, like 
to know who the Jews were, where Babylon was 
situated and who its King was, also when and how 
the City of Jerusalem was built. AH these, and a 
great many other subjects, are connected with the 
history of the Indians, and we design giving a short 
account of each, separatsly.

Never use bad words; because it is very foolish 
as well as very wicked. Some boys think if they 
swear, use slang phrases or big and ugly words, 
arc insulting to their sisters, overbearing to their 
brothers aftd playfellows and disrespectful to their 
mothers, that people will think they are manly and 
bravci but it is not so, nobody likes such boys, and 
they are nearly nlways mean and cowardly. Good 
boys always use ood language, and are respect- 
ful and kind to t cir mothers and their sisters and 
courteous to evei vbody; the consequence is every 
one believes the. , all good people love them, and 
they grow up use I ul, haj)py and respected by all 
their friends and acquaintances,' But when Uttle 
boys learn to swear and swagger and talk vulgarly, 
they soon become so bad that no one has any confi- 
dence in them, they lose all their friends, become 
bad and unhappy men, and sometimes end their 
lives in a very sad and disgraceful manner. 

Little boys and girls, as atcII as men and women, 
should remember that Jesus^Bays we shall have to 
give an account for every idle, naughty word that 
we speak. It is to be feared that many of us will 
have a great many foolish and wicked words and 
speeches to answer for that we shall be very much 
ashamed of and very sorry that we ever uttered. 
If you should ever feel tempted to use bad words 
just think for a moment that God hears you, and, 
though you cannot see Him now, yet, one day, you 
will have to stand before Him and give an account 
of all you have done and said in this life. 

Do not, then, use any evil words, and do not 
associate with any boys or girls who do. If any 



of your playmates indulge in naughty words, you 
had better shun them and not play with them un- 
til they leave ofif their wicked habits. Try to 
associate with those who are good to their mothers 
and fathers, kind to their brothers and isisters and 
courteous and respectful to everybody. Then you 
will learn to be good, and God will love you, and 
your parents and friends will love you, and you 

will become happy and useful men and women.

■DKATH BY CRUCIFYING. 




Deatji by crucifixion, represented here, was very, 
terrible to suffer. It was a very ancient kind of 
punishment, and was usually inflicted upon great 
criminals. The cross was a gibbet formed of two 
pieces of wood, placed across each other, either in 
the shape of the letter X or in the form of this 
illustration, and is supposed to have been suggested 
by the shape which the branches of trees often take, 
as hanging on a tree was a manner of putting peo- 
ple to death, who had committed cvimes, which was 
used even a longer time ago. When the persons 
who were being put to death were fastened on the 

wliich was usually done by driving nniie 



It is not a pleasant subject to talk about, but 
there are many painful things to suffer and to b^ 
talked of in life; and if ray little readers can learn 
knowledge that will keep them from suffering much 
that they otherwise might have to endure, it will 
be well for them.

T H E JEWS. 



Every child who reads this has no doubt heard 
of the Jews. They are to be met with in many 
countries, and though they live like other people 
they are different from them in a great many things. 
They profess to believe in God and in the old Tes- 
tament part of the Bible, but they do not believe 
in the Lord Jesus Christ. They expect to be all 
gathered to a place called Palestine, where their 
fathers lived many hundreds of years ago, and to 
build again the city of Jerusalem, when they be- 
lieve the Messiah, or the Sou of God, vi^ill come to 
them from heaven and save them from their ene- 
mies. They believe many other things, too, that 
we may tell you of again; but now we are going to 
^ell you who they are, where they come from, and 
who their fathers were. 

They are called Jews, and Israelites, and He- 
brews. They are called Jews because one of their 
fore-fathers was named Judah, and that part of 
Palestine, or the Holy Land, where his children 
lived was called Judea, and .sometimes Jewry, , for 
the Jews or children of Judah lived there; Judah's 
father was named Jacob, but he wrestled with an 
angel of the Lord who did not overcome him, and 
the angel named him Israel, which means a prince; 
and therefore they are called Israelites, or the 
children of Israel. One of Jacob's fore-fathers 
was named Eber, or Heber, who was the great- 



erosa. 



through their feet and hands, they were in .^ome 
places left to lie on the ground till they died, and 
stakes, or sticks sharpened at the ends, were driven 
through their bodies; in other places the cross was 
raised up and the bottom end driven violently into 
a hole made in the earth, which often dislocated, or 
drove out of their places, the joints o^ the persons |' 
nailed to it. This form of punishment was in use 
among many ancient nations. The Romans crtici- 
fied only their slaves who were guilty of crimes, 
citizens who were guilty of crimes considered wor- 
thy of death having ihe privilege .of dying by some 
other means, death by the cross being thought too 
degrading. Hence it is said that Paul, one of the 
Saints of former days, had the privilege of beiiag 
beheaded, or having his head cut off, which was a 
speedy kind of death compared with that of the 
cress, and not near so painful; while Peter, the 
President. of the Twelve Apostles chosen by the 
Lord Jesus -Christ before He .suffered death him- 
self, was crucified; Paul was a Roman oiLizen, 
although a Jew, but Peter was not a Roman citi- 
zen. The only crime which these ancient Saints 
was guilty of was their keeping the commandments 
of God, and for this they were put to death, with 
many others, by the wicked, just as some of the 
Latter-day Saints have been killed for keepisig the 
commandments which God has given them. 

The Savior suffered this terrible and shameful 
death, being crucified between tvro thieves. And 
a great many who call themselves Christians, or 
followers of Christ, pay a groat deal of reverence 
to the cross, more, indeed, to the symbol or sign of 
the manner in which Christ died than to doing 
what He told them to do. 



grandson of Shem, one of Noah's sons, and from 
him, it is said, they came to be called Hebrews. 

Now, though the Jews are called Israelites, you 
inust not imagine that all Israelites are Jews, for 
Jacob or Israelhad twelve sons, and all their des- 
cendants are equally entitled to the name of Israel- 
ites. The Indians in these valleys are really Isra- 
elites, as welUas the Jews, for they are descended 
from Joseph, another of the sons of Israel; and so 
are the descendants of the other ten sons of Jacob, 
who are called the ten tribe^ of Israel; though it 
is not known now exactly where they dwell, but it 
is somewhere in the north country and the Lord 
will make known to us in His own time where the 
place is, and reveal many other things concerning 
them. 

By referring to the book of Genesis, in the bible, 
our little readers will learn of Abraham, 
good man, with whom the Lord talked at 
times, and to whom He made promises coi 
his posterity. lie was so good a man and so tuiih- 
ful to righteousness that he was called the friend of 
God. He had a son in his old age named Isaac, 
who was called the child of promise, and who was 
the father of Jacob; thus all the Israelites were 
the descendants of Abraham, and the heirs of the 
promises made to him, which were that they shoidd 
become very numerous, like the stars in the heavens, 
and that through them all natioris should be blessed- 



Bkafi with us.— It will rao.*t likely be another

but not yet here; and illustratiouB which are or-,

SALUTATpRY. 



In sending forth our littlt^ sheet to the pubUc we 
do so with, at least, a partial consciousness of its 
many defects. The matter which it contains has 
been prepared amid the pressure of other duties, 
and has not received that attention wliich we would 
like to bestow upon it and which we think it reallj' 
deserves. \\'e therefore beg ouv adult patro.ns to 
not view this, our tirst issue, too critically. Should 
they perceive faults, which wc think it more than 
probable many will, we hope tliat they will take 
sufficient' interest in the paper to point them out fo 
i(s, and any suggestions they may oifer will be re- 
ceived with pleasure. It is our intention to profit 
by our own experience, and by every suggestion 
which the experience and good taste of our friends 
and the friends of the paper will make unto us, to 
render this a paper that will be worthy^ of the pat- 
ronage of parents and every person who takes any 
interest in the education and development of the 
children of this Territory. There does not exist a 
single reason, that we can perceive,*- why there 
should not be a well-supported and extensively cir- 
culated first-class child's paper published here. -No 
other community, with which we are acquainted, 
indulge in such high hopes respecting their young 
as do the inhabitants of tliis Territory. The most 
sanguine expectations are entertained in relation to 
the great future which awaits them. It is very 
natural that this should be so; for unto us are the 
promises made. But to have these hopes and ex- 
pectations gratified, steps should be taken to train 
our children and to do all in our power to prepare 
them for the duties that will devolve upon them. It 
is to aid in this work and to supply a want which 
has been long felt to exist that the publication of 
this paper has been undertaken. Money making 
has not been the consideration. With us it is pure- 
ly a labor of love, and we therefore feel a freedom 
in asking for the hearty co-operation of all friends 
of the education of the young that under other cir- 
cumstances delicacy might prevent ns from expres.s- 
ing. Though it is intended to publish this paper 
permanently, still in the beginning we have deemed 
it wise to narrow the expenses to the greatest pos- 
sible extent, until we shall have the opportunity of 
proviug by actual experiment what can be done. 
The price of subscription to the Instructor 
may seem unreasonably high to those who -have 
been accustomed to the low prices at which period- 
icals of this description are sold elsewhere; but to 
properly understand this matter, it must be borne 
in mind that this paper is not published by a soci- 
ety, enriched by bequests and'donatious for this and 
kindred purposes; but by private individuals, who 
can invest but a comparatively small amount of 
capital in addition to their personal labors.

In this country, and in all countries in the north 

part of the earth, January is in the middle tff 

winter. But in countries in the south part of the 

earth it is in the middle of summer. Here we have 

snow and ice in January. It is very cold; there is 

nothing growing out af the earth, which is harden- 
ed by frost and covered ^'ith snow; but in places 
that are as far south as this place is north, trees are 
covered with leaves, bright flowers are blooming, 
fruit i.s forming and the earth is bringing forth for 
the support of man. It is summer there !iow; but 
when summer comes to us they will have winter. 
Think of flowers, trees covered with leave.'^, green 
grass and warm summer suus in January! Many 
would wish to be where they are. But think again 
that when wc enjoy that pleasant season, they who 
now enjoy it will have winter.

tops vi'ould be always covered with snow; they 
would then be higher than what is called the snow 
line, because at that hight it would always be so 
cold that snow could remain unmelted. There are 
some places where snow never falls, because it is so 
warm even in the winter, that the watery vapor 
does not freeze. In those countries snow is a great 
luxury, and so is ice when it can be got in the very 
warm seasons. You can keep snow unmelted until 
the middle of summer by making it into hard balls, 
rolling them in tiour, and putting them in a closely 
covered crock which should be kept in a cool cel- 
lar. The tlour is also a "bad conductor" of heat 
or cold.

'^mu from Batmt, 



[For tlu' Juviiilo Inslnu-lur. 

A T REE. 



January is the first month of tlie year. It is 
called January from Janus, a heathen god of the 
Romans, that was always represented with two 
faces; and as the first mouth of the year may be 
said to look back upon the past and forward to the 
future, a Roman named Numa gave it the name of 
January, as Janus was supposed to look tvi'o ways 
with its two faces. Janus was not a man, for no 
man has two faces; it was only an idol, or false god, 
but those who worshiped it believed it to be like a 
man. 



The ground is covered with snow. People with 
nice sleighs drawn by horses or mules glide over it 
very raj)idly ; and the sleigh-bells that jire hung on 
the animals make a very pretty jingliiig noise. Boys 
with small sleds are enjoying themselves by "coast- 
ing" or sliding very rapidly down some sloping 
place on their sleds. They do not seem to mind a 
tumble in the snow much, although it is quite cold. 
Do any of thorn ever think what snow is? It is 
the vapor of the clouds which is gradually frozen; 
and it usually falls in thin, light flakes, which are 
quite white, and when enough of them fall they 
cover the ground as at the present time. If it were 
warmer weather, these flakes would be melted and 
fall to the earth in the shape of rain. Sometimes 
snow falls in little particles, which are nearly round; 
this is when the air is colder, which freezes them 
harder, and when the wind blows, which has a ten- 
dency to break up the broad flakes into the fine dust- 
like snow which we sometimes see. The flakes are 
very prettily formed, as you can find by catching 
some of them, as they fall, on the crown of a black 
hat, or on anything black. They are very lio>ht 
which is caused by the small amount of water con- 
tained in snow compared with its bulk. If you fill 
a pot with snow and set it on the stove to melt, it 
will be found thnt there is only a very small quan- 
tity of water in the pot when the snow has " disap- 
peared. This proves that snow is not frozen rain, 
but frozen vapor, which is much lighter than rain. 
Though snow is very cold it makes a warm cover- 
ing for the earth or whatever it covers, for it will 
not let the warmth of the earth pass away, nor the 
cold frosts get down to il: it js therefore called a 
"bad conductor" of heat or cold. Snow-balling is a 
favorite amusement at tirnes, yet sometimes the 
snow will not form into balls, but crumbles in the 
hand. Did our readers ever think why snow could 
be made into balls at one time and not at another? 
The flakes are formed with very fine points of 
crystols and these get mixed together by the pres- 
sure of the hand, and hold together forming a ball; 
but when the snow is frozen qnickly these points 
are not perfectly formed, and they will not pass in 
between each other, nor hold. 

There are places in the world so cold that if a 

stream of air from the outside is allowed to pass 

.suddenly into a room where people are, their breath 

will be changed into lighi snow-flakes as they 

breathe. There is also a country where the snow 

becomes red, and is called red snow. It does not 

fall red, but a minute vegetable which secretes a 

red coloring matter grows upon it, and gives to 

j the snow a red color. This is away in the north, in 

I what are called the Arctic region.s. In some places 

j the snow never goes away entirely, but remains 

lyear after year. If the twin-peaks in the East 

mountains were a few hundred feet higher, their

nor Latin, but a young, fresh heart, ready to re- 
ceive anything that is sweet, lovely and good, will 
they not listen to nie for a little while? Not a 
learned Professor, with spectacles and snuff-box, 
dried up behind his books, shall speak to you, but 
I have invited an old friend of mine that will speak 
in a language better than Greek or Latin, truer 
than any book, sweeter than any poet, — the lan- 
ffuao-e of nature. Our teacher of to-dav is a tree, or 
rather a fallen tree, in fact, the trunk of a tree 
yonder «n the wayside, at the mouth of the kanyon! 
What! can a tree talk? you ask, and I answer, 
listen to him, he will tell the story of his own life. 

You see, ray young friends, where the saw has cut 
the tree, a great number of rings around the centre; 

every iree puts on one of them every year ; I coun- 
ted the rings in this one; there are 150; this tree 

tells us, therefore, that he was 130 years old when 
he was cut down. From the centre to the thirty- 
ninth -ring you see them all fine, even, strong and 
regular, only on one place we notice them closely 
pressed together; he wants to tell us by tluit, that 
the first thirty- nine years of his youth were spent in 
prosperity, in company with another tree close by 
his side, who was, however, suddenly taken away 
from him, for we see the fortieth ring in that place 
describing its uninterrupted circnmference again. 
But, do you not notice from the forty-fifth to the 
forty-ninth rings how thinly they look, how close 
they are together? In these years of his life he 
had very little to subsist upon, little snow in winter, 
not much rain in summer, and he went through a 
time of famine for four years; but you see how he 
recovered again in the following years and made up 
for the loss sustained. IIow beautiful and fully de- 
veloped are his rings now again, up to the ninety- 
second. But what do we see here? The next eight 
rings are disturbed all of a sudden on this side, as if 
he had received a severe shock; and do you notice 
on his outside that long overgrown scar? When 
he was ninety-two years old a flash of lightning- 
struck him, and it took eight years to heal np the 
injuries he received by it, as we can see on his rings, 
for the houdrcdth is again fully round. This side 
of the tree was turned to the weather, for the tex- 
ture of his wood is stronger here; this side was pro- 
tected by some rock or mountain, which the lighter 
color indicates. ^ He was a tree that spread his 
branches far and wid.e, for you see the thick stumps 
yet protruding throbgh his bark; and in the latter 
part of l>is life hta top was broken oflfby some storm 
of wind or other cause. 

He is now far from his kin, hut the s.e<:d he has 
left behind has germinated, and other trees, npott 
whom, like upon his children, he has been looking

it and adorn yonder mountains. 

When, my childreu, this trunk, lying ^t our feet, 
ccin tell us so much of itself: when the voice of na- 
nire, even out of that tree, speaks to us in such true 
and intelligible words of the works of God, should

This is a locomotive steam engine, with a train of 
Dassencjer cars behind it. It is called locomotive, 
because it moves from place to place. There arc 
other kinds of steam engines which do not move 
from one place-to another, aud'^they are called sta- 
tionary engines. This engine and the cars behind 
it run on rails made of iron, and go very quickly; 
i( can go much quicker than any horse. It is driven 
l»y steam; and that man who is standing at the back 
part of the engine, just over the hind wheels, is the 
driver. He., does not use any whipj' but he under- 
stands tlie machinery, and knows how to work it so 
that the engine will go slowly or quickly. He has 
no need to feed oats or hay or barley to it; but he 
ha.s a man to help him, who keeps putting coal or 
wood into a furnace that makes the water hot, from 
which the steam is made. Steam is water which 
lias been heated until it expands or spreads out to 
about L,700 times the amount of space it occupied 
us vrater. You can understand that it will exercise 
great power when thus expbxnded, in trying to force 
its way out, if it is confined as it is in the boiler in 
wliich the water is heated. 

This on ijc seen in a limited degree by' watch- 
ing a tea-kettle boiling, on which the lid is a little 
loose. The steam, in trying to force its way out, 
makes the lid of the ketfcle rattle. If the spout was 
stoppcfl nil, it would do this more viobntly, but part 
of ,the steam escapes that way^j and it is when the 
water is being converted into steam faster than 
there is room for it pass oif by the spout, that it 
makes the lid rattle in trying to get out in some 
other way. If the Spout and lid were both closed 
very tight, and the lire under the kettle made very 
hot, the sieam would jjurst it. 

This is the power that is taken advantage oi' 
and directed by engineers so that it will drive ships 
throuii'h the water, and <ireat trains of cars, loaded 
with freight and passengers, over the railroads on 
hind. In some countries, particularly in England 
and the United States, steam is applied to a great 
many purposes, and it aan be regulated so nicely, that 
the macliinery which it moves, will work a hammer 
several tons weight, so as to strike a blow not heavy 
enougli to break a needle, _ or strike one heavy 
enough to flatten a large bar of iron. A great 
many kinds of 4nanufactures*are made by steam, — 
that is, steam sets the machinery in motion and 
keeps it working. These manufactures are so nu- 
merous that it Avould take up much space to simply 
name them. And it is likely to be applied to a great 
many more purposes than it is now. 

A railroad lia.=? been commcnci'd to be buill'aoross 



the plains east of this valley, and also west of it, 
that is expected to run close by Great Salt Lake 
City. On it, when it is built, carriages will run like 
that which our- illustration shows, and people will 
be able to go to New York^sr San Francisco in 
much less time than they can now do by mule teams. 
It is a very long time since men began to think 
that steam could be applied to useful purposes; but 
it is not such a great while since it really was 
brought much into use. It has grown very rapidly, 
though. 

A man named Robert Pgl'ton, boru in the St^^e 
of Pennsylvania, in 1186, was the first man who 
ever drove a vessel with a steam engine, for pur- 
poses of carriage, that actually succeeded, though 
others had tried to do it before him, and some had 
been able to make them go on the water. Fultou's 
vessel was named the Clermonlyivnd slie made l;ier 
first tri}^ between New York and Albany, in the au- 
tumn of the year 180t; that is a little over 58 years 
ago. Now there are thousands of steamboats oi 
various sizes that run on the rivers, sail oil the lakes 
and seas, and cross the great oceans in many parts 
of the earth. 

The man who first carried i)assengers in cars, 
driven by steam on a railroad, was named George 
Stephenson, an Englishman, who built a railroad 
between Liverpool and Manchester, in England, and 
carried passengers over it in 1837, thirty years 
after the Ckrmunt had made the trip from Js^ew 
York to Albany, and, therefore about twenty-eight 
years ago. Cars had been driven before that tim-e 
by steam to carry coals from the coal i)its in some 
places in England, and for other similar purposes; 
and stationary engines had been used previous to 
then for pumping, manufactures, etc. "^ 

To learn much more that is useful and d^isirable' 
to know concerning steam, our youug readers must 
get books that treat upon the subject and study 



tiicm.

invite their continued cooperation in increasing the 
usefuluess and extending, the circulation of the 
Juvenile Instructor. It is also gratifying to feel 
the interest which .Presideut Young has manifested 
towards the enterprise; and to realize that his best 
wishes and blessing accompany it for its success and 
permanency, f -n (i i hrough which good may 

be done. 

We likewise solicit the aid of the Bishops and 
Presiding Elders in the various settlements, as well 
as teachers and parents, iu raising our subscription 
list to a figure that "will enable us to more success- 
fully accomplish what we desire. 

To Farents and Teachers. — Although it is in- 
tended to use tile simplest possible languug(,' ade- 
quate to express the ideas desired to be conveyed 
to the minds of childreu; still, it will be impossible, 
even if it were desirable, not to use many words 
and refer to many places whiclvwill need explana- 
tion, and, very probably, reference to dictionaries 
and maps. The benefit thus derived, both lo par- 
ents and children, will amply repay the trouble.

One day 'a little boy was learning to write; he 
had surmounted the difficulty of straight strokes — 
for difficult they are at first— and a harder copy 
was set. The child looked at it again and again, 
but at the sight he was greatlv di-sheartened: it 
seemed impossible that he could form such lines, 
an^** bursting into tears, he said, "I caiu.iot do 
it." 

His judicious and kind friend and tutor did not 

eliide him, but taking him by the hand, soothed his 

troubled spirit, and said: "The wise and active 
conquer diflBiculties by daring to attempt them. 
Sloth and folly shiver and shrink at the sight of 
toil and danger, and make the impo.^sibilities they 
fear: — Try!" The pupil returned to his task with 
new confidence; the trifling difficulty he felt was 
soon overcome: but the lesson he had received was 
a lesson for life. Often did he relate this incident 
with interest. "Try," was cpustantly his motto, 
and he urged others also to make it theirs. 

There was n pchool-boy who, ^Yhile others were 
at play, was engaged in mechanical eontrivauces, 
either imitating something he had seen, or cairying 
out a plan of his own. For this purpose he pro- 
vided liimself with little saws, hatchets, hammers 
and all sorts of tools, which he learned to use with 
great dexterity. A windmill was being-erected not 
far from where he lived, and he so often and atten- 
tively observed the worktaen, that he became ac- 
quainted with all its machinery. He now tried to 
make a model of it, which was frecpiently placed on 
the top of the house, and was put in motion by the 
action of the wind upon its sails. Not content 
with thus imitating the windmill, he formed the 
idea of driving his model by animal power, and for 
this purpose he shut up in it a mouse, which he 
called the miller, and which was made to give mo- 
tion to the machine. Some say the mouse was made 
to advance, by pulling a string attached to its tail; 
while others allege that its power was called forth 
by its unavailing attempts to reach a portion of corn 
placed above the wheel. 

Another machine of his was a water-clock, made 
out of a box he had obtained from a frieud; it was 
about four feet high, and somewhat like a common 
house-clock. The hand of the dial-plate was turn- 
ed by a piece of wood, which either rose or fell by 
the action of dropping water. As it stood in his 
own jjedroom, he supplied it every morning with 
the water if^-equired, and it was used as a clock by 
,the family. If, iiowevcr, he thus occupied himself, 
and scarcely ever joined iu the common games of 
his schoolfellows, he found great pleasure in improv- 
ing their amusements. He taught them first how 
to fly paper kites, and took great pains in determin- 
ing their best shapes and sizes, and the place and 
number of the points by which the string should be 
fastened. Nor was he less attentive to his young 
female friends; it was one of his most agreeable 
occupations to construct for them- little tatiles and 
cupboards, and other utensils for holding their dolls 
and their trinkets. 

Throughout his future life, "Try'- was his motto: 
an^ what was the consequence? That schoolboy 
became Sir Isaac Newton. — [KivrJ Words.
